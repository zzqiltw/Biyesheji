yes , mr . briggs . we have a window table for you . this way , please .
will this table be all right , sir ?
certainly . it &apos;s quite good . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome , sir . this separate room has a very good view of the city , especially at night . you can enjoy the colorful streets decorated with all kinds of lights .
that &apos;s wonderful . but by the way , this room is near the band platform . is it going to be very noisy when the band plays ?
i really don &apos;t like the music being played right beside me .
oh , don &apos;t worry , sir . the sound of the music in quite soft . it shouldn &apos;t cause you any inconvenience .
could you stay and listen to it for a while ?
if you don &apos;t like it , i &apos;ll find another table for you .
would that be ok , sir ?
that &apos;s great . you really do have good service .
it &apos;s very kind of you , sir . just doing my job .
here is your menu . i &apos;ll be back in a few minutes to take your order .
mr . norman is getting his last dish . it &apos;s different from what he ordered .
excuse me , sir . i ordered a sweet and sour fish but you &apos;ve given me a sweet and sour pork .
i &apos;m awfully sorry , sir . there must have been some mistake .
i do apologize for giving you the wrong dish .
i &apos;ll change it immediately for you .
but i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t have enough time to wait .
i have an appointment at 7 : 00 in my room .

and we &apos;ll cross the sweet and sour pork off the bill .

do you mind if i ask the wine steward to bring you something to drink first ?

i have to say that the tablecloth is a disgrace .

i never saw one as big as that before .
i never saw one as big as that before .
it &apos;s easy for me .
i &apos;ve been doing this for more tan ten years .
are you italian ?
as a matter of fact , my great-grandfather came over from sicily at the turn of the century .
do you speak italian ?
probably about as much as you do .
would you like some dessert now , miss ?
ok . do you have strawberry pie ?
i &apos;m afraid there isn &apos;t any more .
then i &apos;ll have vanilla ice cream .
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s gone , too .
so , what do you have ?
all we have now is chocolate cake .
i don &apos;t like chocolate . i &apos;ll just have coffee , please .
all right . i &apos;ll bring it right away .
have you chosen something to eat , sir ?
yes , i think i &apos;ll have the curry , please .

we sincerely welcome you pointing out any of our shortcomings .
how would you like your coffee ?
i take it with cream and sugar .
just a minute , sir .
hi , graham , it &apos;s been a long time .
hello , old friend . long time no see . how are you doing ?
well , i &apos;m doing ok . and how about yourself ?
not so well . to be honest with you , i broke up with jane .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to hear that . what happened ?
i &apos;ve got to apologize for bothering you so much .
there &apos;s no reason to apologize for such a small matter .
do drop in on me when you &apos;re in town .
great to hear from you . i &apos;ve only got three minutes before i &apos;m due at a meeting .
ok , let &apos;s get right to business .
thanks for your understanding .
i &apos;m sorry for being late .
it &apos;s not your fault . i know there is traffic jam today . the radio said it just now .
actually , i should have left home earlier .
if you can , try to next time .
this is mr . hudson of sony electronics finance department .
oh , hello , mr . hudson .
you might already know , but i &apos;ll be retiring at the end of this month .
oh , i didn &apos;t know that .
my successor will be a mr . donald .
we &apos;ll sorry to see you go . what do you intend to do after you retire ?
i &apos;ll be working as a consultant at an international company .
i hope you &apos;ll keep in touch .
there &apos;s something else i &apos;d like to talk to you about .
carol , i have very limited time .
could you make it quick ?
what i want to know is whether you &apos;ll go to the movies with me .
you seem to know your way around guangzhou .
i &apos;ve been here several times on business .
may i ask your advice on what places to see ?
i &apos;d be very happy if you could show me around the pearl river delta this time .
it &apos;ll be a pleasure .
i &apos;m going to have some people over for dinner saturday night . would you like to join us ?
oh , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll be busy tomorrow evening .
some other time then ?
ok . thanks for asking me .
could you sleep last night ?
no , the storm was so terrible .
i was in a taxi when the storm was starting .
some trees were blown over . many streets were flooded by the heavy rainstorm , and the traffic was delayed for almost 2 hours .
when did you get home ?
at 11 pm .
but the worst was that my house was full of water , too .
how terrible ! but i still think we are luckier than those who lost their homes .
i hear 3 people died in the rainstorm .
that &apos;s terrible .
oh , sally , we &apos;re having a potluck party at my house this weekend . will you come and join us ?
what &apos;s a potluck party ?
that &apos;s party where the guests bring the food .
we learned about them in america .
that sounds interesting . but what should i bring ?
anything you think is special .
joe &apos;s service station . can i help you ?
my car &apos;s broken down .
could you send a tow truck ?
could you tell me your name and location ?
i &apos;m on lincoln street , in front of the third national bank . my name is david hudson .
ok . i &apos;ll dispatch a truck right away . please wait for a little bit .
i was shocked to hear about the fire on the news last night &apos; .
are you all right ?
luckily , yes .
but we don &apos;t know when we &apos;ll be able to get work going again .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that . i hope the damage isn &apos;t too severe .
no , it &apos;s not too bad . thank you for calling .
i apologize for the misunderstanding .
don &apos;t worry any more about it .
i hope we can understand each other better in the days to come .
frankly , i &apos;m tired . can we take a break ?
yes , we &apos;re all exhausted .
let &apos;s call it a day , and go over the third part next time .
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t go to your party .
that &apos;s perfectly all right .
i had to take my little sister to the hospital , you know .
that &apos;s more important , of course .
my very best wishes to you and husband !
thank you . i &apos;m so happy you were able to attend our wedding .
you couldn &apos;t have kept me away .
sorry , i couldn &apos;t help overhearing . did you mention jack davidson just now ?
yes , jack has been elected chairman of the committee .
how about john ?
john lost by twenty votes .
hello . i &apos;ve lost my credit card , so i &apos;d like to cancel it .
alright , sir .
please give me your full name and the credit card number .
david huang . h-u-a-n-g .
the card number is bk1118882822 .
the card will be canceled immediately , sir .
we &apos;ll also issue a new card for you right away , free of charge .
where would you like us to send it ?
i think i &apos;ll pick it up myself at your local office .
anything interesting to see here ?
there &apos;re many places : frontierland , fantasyland , tomorrowland and adventureland .
what do you like best ?
they &apos;re all fascinating .
i never expected to find vitamins in a supermarket .
oh , really ? why not ?
in beijing , we often have to go to a drugstore , and they &apos;re not expensive .
then you should stock up on them while you &apos;re here .
but there are so many kinds , and i don &apos;t know which one to buy .
maybe i can help you .
do you need vitamin c ?
how long will it take to have it recharged ?
normally around eight hours , sir .
i &apos;m sure my boy will like it .
let me see how it works , first .
there &apos;s nothing to it .
it operates just like a real plane , but only simpler and meant for a kid .
how much are these tennis rackets ?
these are $ 200 and these are $ 180 .
$ 200 is too expensive . $ 180 is still too expensive .
may i see some cheaper ones ?
sorry , this is all we have .
i see . i like this $ 180 racket very much .
could you give me a 25 % discount ?
sorry , our prices are fixed .
do you have &quot; the text of spoken english &quot; ?
what edition do you want ?
the latest , of course .
we have a paperback and a hardback version .
which would you like ?
i think i &apos;ll take the hardback because it &apos;s more durable .
that &apos;s a good decision .
what smart blouses !
yes , we have many styles and colors here .
what style will look better on me ?
i think that long-sleeved blouse fits you well .
what material , cotton , silk or linen ?
linen .
yes , i &apos;ll take two then .
do you want to see more colors ?
have you got any in blue in stock ?
no . blue is out of fashion .
emerald green will do , then .
how much do they come to in all ?
four hundred and eighty dollars .
is there anything i can help you with ?
yes , i was wondering if you could help me find some travel guides for this city .
we have a variety of books on that subject .
some are quite general while others are more specialized .
i guess a generalized one would be ok .
in that case , maybe this book will do .
that &apos;s perfect . i &apos;ll buy that one .
i &apos;d like to buy a suitcase .
the suitcases are over here .
these are very well-made .
they &apos;re very strong .
how about one like this ?
it &apos;s nice , but it &apos;s too small .
i need a bigger one .
well , how about these ?
these are the biggest ones we &apos;ve got .
yes , that &apos;s about the right size .
how much is this one ?
it &apos;s 85 dollars .
what can i do for you , miss ?
i want to buy a bra .
any particular style ?
i &apos;ll just have a look first .
this one , please .
ok . it &apos;s brand name .
do you have any padded bras in the same color ?
yes , we do . how about this padded lace bra ?
how much do you charge ?
14 . 50 dollars .
if you buy a set with underwear , it comes to 35 dollars .
the underwear alone is 26 . 50 dollars .
then i &apos;ll take a set with underwear .
can i have my money back for this skirt ?
anything wrong with it ?
yes , this is defective . see ?
i didn &apos;t notice this hole when i bought it .
oh , i &apos;m very sorry about that .
you can change it for another one if you prefer .
if you have one exactly the same - the same color , same design , and same size , of course .
this one is the same size and color .
but the design is different .
oh , i guess i have no choice . i &apos;ll take this one .
may i help you , ma &apos;am ?
yes , i want to buy an electric fan .
oh , i &apos;m terribly sorry .
the electric fans are out of stock now .
well , when will you have some ?
probably tomorrow morning .
well , i &apos;ll buy one tomorrow .
we are very sorry to have inconvenienced you .
the following day
any good news ?
well , i can hardly say that . however , i &apos;m still hopeful .
have you got a reply from your head office ?
yes , i &apos;ve received a long cable , but it doesn &apos;t actually say anything new .
do you mean the price is still the same as that mentioned yesterday ?
yes , it is the same , but let me point out that the tallow market conditions have been anything but easy of late .
the recent currency crisis has not made things any better .
would you enlighten me further as to the market conditions ?
i believe that you have followed up the supply position , and that you &apos;re as well informed as i am .
could you tell us about the supply position at your end ?
as you know , situations are apt to change in the commodity market . as far as tallow supplies are concerned , there are most pressing demands from clients in other parts of the world . the upward trend is quite strong .
i hope you will appreciate our position .
i gather from what you say that the outlook is not very promising .
it &apos;s rather disappointing that you should come all the way from australia to tell us of such a bleak prospect .
things are not all that bad .
you may recall that we once drew your attention to drummed tallow .
in regards this item , the situation is slightly better .
if you could accept this instead , we could supply the quantity you require .
we are not interested in drummed tallow for the simple reason that its price is higher .
i understand .
but there is a very strong trend in its favor on the international market .
we are having difficulty in getting hold of any sizable parcels of bulk tallow for immediate shipment .
i should tell you that india has just entered the market with an inquiry for 6 , 000 tons .
this certainly has its effect on our market and also in the usa and canada .
we know this , but the question is whether they will agree to such a high price .
in any case , there simply aren &apos;t any sizable parcels around .
as the situation stands now , we can only offer 1 , 000 tons of bulk tallow at the price quoted yesterday .
if you can get your end users interested in drummed tallow , we &apos;ll do our best to offer more , say 3 , 000 tons , with an additional charge for the drums and the drumming cost at us $ 45 per ton .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t entertain your proposition .
well then , there is nothing i can do but to make a long distance call home tonight to see once more what can be done .
please do . i hope to hear from you soon .
i &apos;ll appreciate it if you can give us a counter-offer .
i &apos;m afraid that can &apos;t be done .
unless you propose something definite together with some improvement in your price , we will not be inclined to place a large order with you .
however , in view of the friendly relations between us , we are willing to hold negotiations with you again the day after tomorrow .
i &apos;ll get in touch with my head office right away .
all right . well , it seems that you &apos;ve already given a lot of thought to this issue . do you have any specific proposals ?
yes . how about this ?
if the defect rate is 1 % , then the penalty rate will be 1 % of the contract value .
from 2 % to 5 % .
wait a minute .
could you first of all give me a clear definition of defect ?
any defect : unevenly-stitched buttonholes , stains on the blouses , improper hemming , missing trimmings , wrong labeling , etc .
i think such defects fall into two types and we should work out different penalty rates for them .
sounds reasonable .
but how would you categorize the defects ?
the first type are major defects , such as missing trimmings and stains on the blouses , which may render the garments unsuitable for sale .
the second type are minor defects , such as uneven stitches and improper hemming , which will not make the garments unsalable .
so in order to arrive by september 1 , the goods must leave xingang before august 10 .
well , you do have a very tight schedule here .
perhaps you should have made the order a bit earlier .
i wish i could have , but people &apos;s tastes in garments change so fast .
therefore , in order to make a better prediction as to which design will win us customers we have to wait until just two or three months before the season .
the nearer the season draws , the better we can predict .
i see , but that will place greater pressure on the garment manufacturers .
that &apos;s true , and this is why garments makers are now competing not only in quality and price but also in speed of delivery .
the sooner you can make the delivery , the more orders you will have .
i &apos;d like to make an early delivery , but my factories are already working at full capacity .
can you rearrange your schedule and make my order your top priority ?
all right , i &apos;ll rearrange the production schedule .
but the best i can do is to deliver the blouses five days earlier , that is , by august 15 .
i really appreciate that , but could you make it a few more days earlier , mr . li .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t .
all right . that &apos;s settled .
august 15 .
i &apos;m sorry to inform you of this , but we found that there are some faulty materials in the consignment which we have recently shipped to you .
oh , that &apos;s quite unusual for your company , isn &apos;t it ?
well , thank you for your compliment .
and , what would you like us to do ?
we would like you to ship back the entire consignment to us and we will send you a replacement right away .
o . k . will do .
good morning , mr . emerson . i hope your trip has been a pleasant one so far .
thank you i have been having a wonderful time .
is this your first visit to japan ?
yes , although my wife and i have often talked about visiting japan in the past .
oh , is your family with you on this trip ?
well , my wife came along , but since this is a business trip we didn &apos;t bring any of our children .
hello , mr . wang .
i &apos;m calling to sort out my visit to new york next week .
i &apos;ll go and get the file . i won &apos;t be a moment . ok , i &apos;ve got it .
i want to go over my itinerary there and take some notes .
in that case , i &apos;ll meet you in your office now .
i &apos;d like to cancel a reservation .
is the reservation for yourself or for another party ?
it &apos;s for my boss , dr . bob walter .
ok , i &apos;ll cancel dr . walter &apos;s reservation from july 12th for 2 nights .
we look forward to another chance to serve you .
i &apos;m very unhappy with your restaurant service .
i was badly treated by a rude waiter .
i &apos;m terribly sorry about this , sir .
i will contact the food and beverage manager immediately . he &apos;ll take care of this .
may i have your name and room number ?
walter in room 4052 .
please accept my apology on behalf of the hotel , mr . walter .
this is mr . wu in room 16 .
i &apos;d like to know the room number of my friend , mr . nash .
mr . nash is in room 50 . his phone number is also 50 .
front desk , california hotel . may i help you ?
yes , my name is jones . i checked out of your hotel this morning .
unfortunately , i left some documents in my room .
what was your number , sir ?
i believe i was in room 1531 .
where did you leave the documents ?
in the top drawer of the desk .
i see , sir . i &apos;ll try to find them , and i &apos;ll call you back .
would you please call me at 123-4567 ?
good afternoon , i have a question about my bill .
here are the copies of your laundry bills .
let me see . the laundry charge is too high .
is there a mistake ?
oh , i &apos;ll check again the laundry record .
i only used the laundry service three times . it &apos;s impossible .
yes . i think there must be a mistake .
oh , excuse me ! i &apos;ll come back later .
that &apos;s ok . i &apos;d rather have it cleaned now .
do you mind if i stay here while you clean ?
no , not at all . it &apos;s beautiful weather today , isn &apos;t it ?
yes . i &apos;m planning to go the zoo later .
would you like to store something ?
yes , i &apos;d like to use a safety deposit box .
will it fit into a box this size ?
let me see . i think it &apos;s ok .
be careful with the key , please . there &apos;s no spare .
hold the line , please . i will check our room availability .
thank you for waiting . we have double rooms on april 15th .
i see . how much are the rooms ?
we have two types available , $ 100 rooms and $ 150 rooms . which would you prefer ?
the $ 100 sounds fine .
have you a single room for two nights ?
yes , but only on the top floor .
how much is it ?
4 . 50 pounds with service and tv .
fair enough . can you show me the room , please ?
of course . could you follow me , please ?
i &apos;d like this garment dry-cleaned .
i &apos;m sorry we don &apos;t have the equipment necessary .
that &apos;s a nuisance !
i &apos;m very sorry we can &apos;t help you , ma &apos;am .
that &apos;s not your fault .
can you check-in here , please ?
yes . where &apos;s my room ?
on the third floor .
your room number is 3051 .
our porter will take your bags and show you the room .
is this the front desk clerk ?
this is mr . hudson in room 771 .
i &apos;ve just returned to find that my room has been broken into .
i see , sir . i &apos;ll send someone to your room now and contact the police .
did you leave your door unlocked ?
no , when i went out i definitely locked the door .
but when i returned the door was open .
please don &apos;t touch anything . our security guard will be with you soon .
i understand , thank you .
i &apos;m a beginner , so how can i get used to the ball ?
don &apos;t worry , man .
there are drills and exercises to help you get to know the ball .
what do you want me to begin with ?
we will begin with the around the body exercise .
hold the ball in your right hand , move it around from in front of your waist to your back , pass it into your left hand then bring the ball back around to in front of your waist .
repeat this ten times .
then change direction , starting with the ball in your left hand in front of the waist , switch it to your right hand behind your back and bring the ball around back to in front of your waist .
repeat this ten times .
what &apos;s the purpose of doing it ?
it &apos;s basic skills .
remember , your first aim is not to drop the ball and your second aim is not to look at the ball .
what are the referee &apos;s responsibilities ?
he is responsible for conducting the match according to the rules .
then how is a foul committed ?
a foul is committed if one player trips , kicks , strikes , obstructs or holds an opponent .
how can a referee penalize a player ?
can he send off the player ?
for a minor offense , the referee may award a free kick .
for a first technical offense , a referee can show the yellow card . for a second technical offense a ref shows the player red card to send them off the field .
what is offsides , kerry ?
a player is offside if he receives a forward pass from a teammate in the opponent &apos;s half of the field , with fewer than two opponents between himself and the goal .
how is a foul committed ?
if a player trips , kicks , strikes , obstructs or holds an opponent , he &apos;s committed a foul .
what &apos;s the penalty for it ?
if it &apos;s merely a minor offense , the referee may award a free kick .
for an intentional offense , the offender may be shown a yellow card .
but if he repeats it intentionally , he may be shown the red card . then the player is sent off the field .
do you think it a good means to curb violence on the soccer field ?
to some extent , yes .
when is a penalty kick awarded ?
that &apos;s when a serious foul is committed inside the penalty area .
why are you so interested in soccer today ?
i &apos;ve got a ticket for the match between argentina and poland .
did you see the tennis match last saturday ?
who was playing ?
our favorite tennis player , of course , michael chang .
oh , him ! i enjoy watching him play . i think he &apos;s really great .
how did he do ?
he won , but it was really rough .
who was he playing ?
he was playing against vince spadea .
i think spadea thought he had won the match and then he choked and chang charged .
chang must not have been playing a very good game if spadea was winning .
i know that chang has beaten him several times .
it &apos;s true , he wasn &apos;t playing his best though the first part of the match .
i think chang is the ultimate tennis survivor , however .
yes , he looked as if he could barely lift his feet between points , but he kept scrambling until he wore spadea down to win a match that lasted nearly four hours .
after the match he just paced back and forth and was unable to sit down for fear of his whole body cramping up .
wow ! he really was determined to win .
that &apos;s why i like watching him play .
how are the astros doing this year ?
they &apos;re in first place by two games .
do you think they &apos;ll be able to go all this year ?
well , they &apos;re a pretty young team , and the dodgers are coming on strong , too .
do you come to a lot of baseball games ?
did you manage to go to the volleyball match last night ?
yes , i was lucky . mr . smith gave me his ticket .
who won ?
the chinese team , but it was very close .
i &apos;m sorry i missed it .
what &apos;s the rate for one of your minis ?
the daily rate is 2 . 20 pounds , and the weekly 15 pounds .
right then . i &apos;d like to book one for next friday , please .

each is using a straight left to feel his opponent .
martin is more active and punches more .
martin &apos;s pressing lewis .
lewis sways back .
martin uses a jab and a combination .
lewis bobs , parries outside and counters with a right cross .

round two .
basically , lewis is defending .
look , lewis is repeatedly effectively jabbing martin .
martin clinches lewis .
lewis hits martin below the belt .
the referee breaks them .

solomon , what do you think is unique about equestrian events ?
the equality between men and women in participation and the communication and harmony between the rider and the horse .
but men and women are equal in almost all olympic events .
what &apos;s special for equestrian ?
equestrian is the only olympic sports that doesn &apos;t specify which event is or isn &apos;t accessible to women .
any team in the team events can have both men and women .
it &apos;s a policy of real equality , and it &apos;s unique , indeed .
another unique thing is that equestrian emphasizes the harmony between human beings and animals .
whether it is dressage , show jumping , or three-day event , good results won &apos;t occur unless the rider and the horse cooperate well .
you are right .
if the rider and the horse lack communication and harmony between each other , it &apos;s impossible to achieve such wonderful movements that compare with those of elegant ballet performances .
and the horse might refuse or even run out in front the obstacles .
how do the equestrian rules define a &quot; fall , &quot; anyway ?
a rider is considered to have fallen when he or she is separated from his horse .
and a horse is considered to have fallen when both its shoulder and quarters have touched the ground simultaneously .
i think a fall will always be penalized .
the total score will be lowered .
i want to report a mugging , officer .
on my way home from the bank , someone came at me from somewhere and struck me on the head . my handbag was snatched away .
can you give me a description of the assailant ?
he was tall and fat , wearing a black jacket and blue jeans .
and he was also wearing a mask .
fill &apos;er up with unleaded supreme .
right away .
would you check the tire pressure , too ?
of course .
