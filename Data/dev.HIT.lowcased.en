we sell all kinds of things used in ancient chinese imperial places .
they look very interesting , especially the yellow gowns .
they are imperial gowns . ancient chinese emperors wear them .
yellow is a noble color to the chinese people .
the imperial laws forbade the ordinary people to wear yellow .
did they ?
but in my country purple is associated with being noble .
cultures differ from country to country .
why not try them on ?
how much should i pay you for trying it on ?
free of charge .
that &apos;s fine .. is this yellow too bright for me ?
it &apos;s very bright yellow , but it looks terrific on you .
does it ?
what size is it ?
it &apos;s size 8 .
but i wear size 10 .
here is another gown .
it &apos;s size 10 . try it on . you look so smart in the imperial gown .
why not take one as a souvenir ?
it &apos;s cheap . only 100 dollars .
that &apos;s good idea . i &apos;ll take it .
good morning . can i be of any assistance ?
i &apos;m looking for a birthday present for my daughter , but i haven &apos;t make up my mind .
how about a pair of bracelets ?
thank you for your reminding . my daughter likes bracelets .
would you like to have gold , silver or jade bracelets ?
my daughter likes jade bracelets .
there are two types of jade in our shop- - - modern and antique .
which dose she like ?
the modern one , of course .
please look at this pair , first .
the jade bracelets are rather pretty .
but i don &apos;t know how to tell real jade from the plastic imitation
don &apos;t worry , madam .
there are two ways to know real jade from the plastic imitation .
jade is always cool to touch and will resist scratching with metal .
you may use a knife to test it .
thank you for telling me about it .
don &apos;t mention it .
you can always trust in our shop .
then a pair of jade bracelets , please . how much do you want for it ?
twenty-five yuan fec for one , so fifty yuan fec for a pair .
here is one hundred yuan fec .
here are your change and receipt .
the small gift box is complimentary .
thanks a lot .
it &apos;s a pleasure .
drop in again , please .
would you show me this brooch ?
yes , i would .
what kind of stone is this ?
it &apos;s sapphire .
we have only one brooch of this type and this is one of my favorite brooches .
will you try it on ?
yes , i will .
but how much is it ?
only seventy dollars .
seventy dollars ?
it &apos;s expensive for me .
my budget is fifty dollars .
so i wonder if you have anything else within my budget ?
let me see .
how about this one ?
this is just fifty dollars and the same kind of stone as that one .
i like it very much .
but i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t like the design .
what about the other ones ?
eh .. this is the last one that i recommend .
coral , a special product of hawaii .
and the price of forty-eight dollars will meet your budget , i believe .
then , i &apos;ll take it .
i want to buy a raincoat .
could you please show me one ?
with pleasure .
what color do you like ?
yellow , please .

do you know someone who &apos;d like to invest in garments industry in china ?
well , let me think . right , this might be the person you are looking for .
come this way .
alan , i think you might be interested in meeting mr. li .
alan bush of santana apparel . kang li of dafa garments .
and if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;d like to talk to that pretty lady over there .
thank you , mr. taylor .
a very interesting argument , but i guess you &apos;re right .
now mr. li , could you tell me how profits and risks are shared in such a venture ?
it depends on which form the joint venture takes .
basically there are two types of joint venture : equity joint venture and contractual joint venture .
what &apos;s the difference ?
in an equity joint venture , the profits and risks are shared according to the partners &apos; shares of equity in that venture .
the bigger the share , the greater the profits and risks the partner will have .
that &apos;s fair .
then how are the profits and risks shared in the other type of joint venture .
in a contractual joint venture , everything is stipulated in a contract , so is the proportion of profits each partner is entitled to .

could you please tell me something about the english teacher position i saw advertised in this morning &apos;s china times ?

personnel section .
hello , i &apos;m interested in the english teacher position you advertised in today &apos;s china times .

i &apos;m serious , and that reminds me of the second point i &apos;d like to discuss .
what &apos;s that ?
the formula you proposed in the draft to calculate the interest of your financing .
is there anything wrong with it ?
nothing wrong .
i just want to make it more flexible .
that &apos;s interesting , but how ?
well , could you first of all tell me how you make the calculation ?
at the present , the going rate is 3.6 % per annum .
so the interest for six months is 2.4 % of our financing .
that &apos;s correct if we complete the compensation in six months .
but , as i said earlier , what if we are able to do it sooner ?
do you really mean to do it sooner ?
why not if we receive enough cash , as you said earlier , from other sources ?
that &apos;ll reduce our payment for the interest .
i see what you mean .

chinese calligraphy .

they mean long life . i remembered you liked the calligraphy at the palace museum , so i thought you might like it .
that &apos;s very nice of you .
where did you get it ?
it &apos;s not a print .
no , it &apos;s an original .
my father &apos;s friend is a calligrapher , and i had him make it for you . his name and the date are on the bottom .
i &apos;ll hang it in my office .
but i feel bad i didn &apos;t get you anything .
don &apos;t worry about it .
it &apos;s a token of my appreciation for your business , and friendship .
if you have time around christmas , please come to visit my family . i &apos;ll be able to show you around our city .
thanks for the invitation .
and please give my regards to your wife .
you do the same .
well , i &apos;d better go . thanks again for everything .
take care , and have a nice flight .
the plane is crowded today , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
it &apos;s almost completely full .
it &apos;s summer vacation now , and many japanese students are going abroad . just like me , i guess .
where are you going ?
we will go to see &quot; chinese soul &quot; tonight .
what is &quot; chinese soul &quot; ?
it is an acrobatic performance introduced by chinese acrobatic circus .
ah , i see .
how are the programs ?
i hear that they are very nice .
many programs have won medals in the international acrobatic contests .
that is great !
this show seems too boring . how about turning to channel 3 ?
go ahead .
oh , it &apos;s the beginning of a romantic story . it looks good .
the actress is a famous film star in hollywood , isn &apos;t she ?
yes , she is . it is said her acting is outstanding .
then , let &apos;s watch it .
hurry up , or we &apos;ll be late for the movie .
what time does it start ?
it &apos;s supposed to start at 6 : 30 .
jack , please turn on the tv to see what &apos;s on .
yes , mum .
what channel ?

what about channel 10 ?
news and weather .
what &apos;s on following it ?
do you have a guide ?
yes . here it is .

what a pity !
scene 3 at the corner of the street
good afternoon !
will you please tell me how to get to n. w. 5 !
do you want to go there by bus or by tube ?
by tube ?
sorry , i don &apos;t know what &quot; tube &quot; means .
the tube is the underground , don &apos;t you know ?
the americans call it &quot; the subway &quot; .
oh , i see !
you mean the underground railway .
yes , we londoners call it &quot; the tube &quot; .
you haven &apos;t been in london long , have you ?
no . i got her only today , about half an hour ago .
good heavens !
you mustn &apos;t take the tube then .
why not ?
for a stranger here , the london tube could be a maze .
you know what a maze is , don &apos;t you ?
yes , it &apos;s labyrinth .
but i &apos;m in a maze already without going down to the tube .
in that case , you &apos;d better take the bus , to be on the safe side .
by the way , what &apos;s the difference between a bus and a coach ?
buses are double-deckers as a rule .
see that one going down the street ?
that &apos; a typical london bus .
as for coaches , they are mostly long-distance vehicles with soft seats , more comfortable than double-deckers .
you &apos;ve made it very clear . thank you .
now , will you tell me how to get to n. w. 5 by bus ?
let me see . it &apos;s a bit complicated , so just listen to me carefully , please .
all right . go ahead !
first , you cross the road , take the second turning on the left , walk about ten yards down a narrow lane , and you &apos;ll find yourself in another busy street .
then turn to the right , just walk straight ahead , passing two or three blocks , and you &apos;ll find the no.82 bus -stop just outside a big department store .
when you &apos;re on the bus , ask the conductor to put you down at oxford circus .
that &apos;s where you change on to a no.19 bus ; it &apos;ll take you to northwest london .
would that be n. w. 5 ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
but you &apos;ll be somewhere neat it , i guess .
you only guess ?
i thought a policeman should be sure with his answer when he &apos;s asked for information .
but i belong to the police-station of the west end .
how could i know the bus routes in all the other parts of the city ?
i &apos;m not the map of london , miss .
i mustn &apos;t blame you .
it &apos;s such a big city !
but are you clear about what i &apos;ve just bold you ?
do i have to say it again ?
no , don &apos;t bother to repeat it .
from what you &apos;ve told me already , i gather london is a big maze not only under the ground , but also on the ground .
so i &apos;ve made up my mind to take a taxi after all .
thank you very much all the same .
ah !
it would certainly be the safest way .
let me call a taxi for you .
taxi !
ms. koda , did you look up those files i requested ?
i couldn &apos;t find any information on the chicago plant , even though i checked all the cross-references .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s available .
i &apos;m almost certain that information is filed .
would you like me to check again under a different heading ?
yes . in fact , i believe i asked you to put it in mr. hardy &apos;s file .
maybe that &apos;s why i couldn &apos;t find it , all the information on the hardy account is filed under the letter &quot; h &quot; .
what &apos;s the pay like ?
you get $ 8 an hour at first .
how many days a week ?
eight hours a day , five days a week .
how soon would they get a telegram if we sent the message that way ?
according to this brochure , a telegram sent this afternoon would be delivered tomorrow morning , their time .
good . then please prepare this letter for telegram delivery .
which of these words do you want me to abbreviate for the telegram ?
i don &apos;t believe it will be necessary to abbreviate any of them , but leave the first paragraph out . it &apos;s just a greeting .
do you want me to insert &quot; stop &quot; s to mark line ends , or use regular punctuation .
that service allows regular punctuation .
all the salesmen are planning to take you out for dinner .
that isn &apos;t necessary at all .
no. we really want to do it .
in that case , i &apos;ll be glad to go along .
when , may i ask ?
next friday night .
good . i have the evening free .
what &apos;s your name , please ?
my name is li yumei .
i plan to take a train for chengdu .

that &apos;s why i decided to go there by train .

please come again in a month .
well , i guess i have no choice .
i have sharp stomachache , doctor .
how about your appetite ?
not so good as before .
i can &apos;t eat much .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s an acute gastritis .
the doctor &apos;s given me this prescription .
it &apos;ll only take five minutes , so perhaps you &apos;ll wait .
have you also got something suitable for sore lips ?
rub in this cream every fours hours .
what place are you going to show us today ?
we are going to climb wudangshan mountains .
oh , how wonderful !
here we are .

they are a range to the taoists and a number of taoist temples were built here .
oh , that &apos;s great !
this is tianzhu peak , the highest summit of the mountains .
what is the meaning of &quot; tianzhu &quot; in chinese ?
&quot; heavenly pillar &quot; . it means a pillar propping up the sky .
that &apos;s sounds exciting .

well , how will i recognize it ?
when you get to the stop , i &apos;ll remind you .
why do we have to board in the front of the bus ?
there &apos;s no bus conductor in america .

how far does the archer stand from the target , william ?
70 meters .
what &apos;s the measure of the target ?
only l.22 meters in diameter .
it &apos;s really a challenging job to shoot at such a small target from so far away . it must be very hard to hit the center .
it is .
the center is called the bull &apos;s-eye . it is worth l0 point .
besides the bull &apos;s-eye , the target is comprised of nine concentric rings , and the outer ring is worth one point .
i noticed an inner ring within the bull &apos;s-eye .
what is its function ?
it does not count for extra points but is used to decide .
how the points should be counted if an arrow bounces off the target or pierces it ?
the score is taken from the mark left by the arrow , as long as it can be identified .
no points are scored if an arrow misses the target .
how does the archer aims at the target ?
the archer holds the bow in his bow arm and draws back the target arrow at the anchor point with his drawing hand . he looks along the bow sight then releases the arrow at the target .
thank you , williams .
i may ask you more questions about archery later .
you are welcome anytime .
hi , tony !
fancy meeting you here !
hi , jack !
i haven &apos;t seen you for a long time .

i want to send some money to hong kong .
how had i better send it , by postal order or by bank draft ?
how much do you wish to remit ?

postal orders are more convenient for small sums .
thank you for your advice .
where are you going ?
take a walk . i have just watched a game . it was really interesting .
what are you doing ?
we are taking a walk , too .
oh , let me give you a test . what is the most distinct symbol of the olympic games ?
that is a piece of cake . the five rings .
what colors are they ?
how are they arranged ?
red , green , yellow , blue , and black , right ?
as the arrangement .
i think the black color is in the middle , and both sides are .
if our answer is right , we should be rewarded .
i remember that the color of the three upper rings is blue , black , and red ; and the yellow and green ones are under them .
annie , let me ask you a question .
what do the five rings represent ?
what do they indicate ?
jeff , i don &apos;t want to teach fish how to swim before you , the &quot; olympic expert &quot; .
however , your question won &apos;t beat me .
the blue color represents europe , the black represents africa , the red represents america , yellow represents asian , and the green represents australia .
the five rings represent the close unity and friendly meeting at the olympics between athletes from five continents .
annie said it very well .
therefore , there are five rings in both the olympic flag and the olympic emblem , which were carefully designed by mr. baron de coubertin .
mr. baron de coubertin was really great !
annie , i said it right just now . what is the reward ?
well , let me give you an ice cream to relieve your internal heat .
may i help you , sir ?

let me find a big table for you .
it doesn &apos;t matter , i &apos;ll sit here .
here is the menu , please .
well , i heard that your western food is very good .
we have pizza , salad , fried chicken , steak and so on , would you like which one ?
i &apos;d like toast bread and salad .
okay .
good evening , madam and sir !
good evening .
please be seated . here is the menu . would you please order now ?
well , i &apos;ve heard so much about the famous beijing duck and i &apos;ve been wanting to taste it for a long time .
you are right there . it would be a shame to leave beijing without trying peking roast duck .
it &apos;s beijing &apos;s most famous dish and its taste is unique .
can you tell us something about it ?
ok . now i &apos;ll give some ideas about how it became a popular dish , how it is prepared .
and most important of all , how it is served .
right .
the recipe of roasting ducks was first developed by a chef who prepared food for a ming emperor .
later , it was made know to common folks by old chefs dismissed from the royal ming kitchen .
a man named yan quanren came to beijing and began selling cooked ducks and eventually opened a duck restaurant outside qian-men gate and named it quanjude .
after further improvement of the way of roasting ducks , his ducks became all the more tasteful and of course , his restaurant soon earned its fame .
no wonder it is so well-known .
now let &apos;s come to the process of roasting ducks .
first ducks must be cut open , dressed and scalded and dried .
when roasting , it &apos;s better to use fruit tree branches as firewood to lend flavour to the duck .
amazing .
besides , regular temperature is a must to make it roasted evenly .
but how on earth is it eaten ?
i &apos;ll be watering if i wait any longer .
the simple procedure is as follows : first you pick up a pancake and then dip duck pieces into the sweet soybean paste placed in front of you . then you place them with stalks of raw scallion , which should be placed in the centre of the pancake . finally , roll it up for convenience &apos;s sake .
it is excellent .
well , eating is believing . the taste of the roast duck is in the eating .
try and judge. try and judge for yourself .
i &apos;d like a table for three , please .
do you have a reservation ?
no , i don &apos;t .
we &apos;re rather busy right now .
how long will it be ?
i &apos;m not sure .
how about that table over there ?
ah , yes .
i can let you have that one .
follow me , please .
2 . having the continental breakfast
two guests come into the restaurant and go to the reception desk and ask .
is it time for breakfast ?
yes , we serve breakfast from seven to nine in the morning .
what would you like to order ?
we &apos;d like to have the continental breakfast . it &apos;ll save some time .
yes , very good .
and what kind of fruit juice would you like to have ?
we have sorts of them , pineapple , orange , grapefruit .
but do you serve hot coffee ?
certainly , what coffee do you prefer , white or black ?
a cup of white coffee and the pineapple , please .
and the meal ?
we &apos;d like two boiled eggs and two pieces of bread .
buttered or not ?
no butter .
oh , excuse me , where &apos;s the men &apos;s room ?

i &apos;m glad you feel that way i &apos;ve been worried sick about it .

they are state-of-the-art computers .
would you like to see how it works ?
yes , please .
ok , let me just have it all set up in a minute .
they are great for business applications .
look at how fast it runs .
i &apos;m planning to set up a desktop publishing system and i need a computer with a hard disk and runs on a 32-bit .
oh , in that case , this model will do just fine .
do you have the software for it already ?
yes , i have a venturra .
isn &apos;t it for ibm computers ?
yes , they are .
you might also want to get the other paraphernalia that goes with it , like the laser printer .
how is the resolution of your laser printer ?
it &apos;s 300 dpi .
that &apos;s about the best you can get with this model .
there are others with a higher resolution , but they &apos;ll cost more .
are you doing this for business or as a hobby ?
well , i &apos;m starting it out as a hobby , to tell you frankly .
but later on i plan to expand it into a business .
well , this will definitely do .
you can expand the features later on as you become familiar with the system and when you start doing your business .
if i buy the computer now and buy a matrix dot printer , can i trade it for a laser printer later on and pay you the difference plus the cost of the depreciation ?
well , we don &apos;t do it here , but we can tell you where you can do that .
i bought this pair of trousers last friday . as soon as i washed it , i found it shrank .
do you have the receipt ?
yes . i don &apos;t want it any more .
but i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t give you a refund .
why ?
i hope you &apos;re not joking . i spent so much on something i couldn &apos;t wear .
i got annoyed .
try a little calmer .
as a rule , customers are supposed to check all goods thoroughly before purchase as the shop cannot give refunds .
but how do i know that ?
you didn &apos;t tell me about it when i was buying , did you ?
did you rad the sign there ?
what ?
oh .
would you please exchange something else of the same price ? you can exchange for another size !
will that shrink too ?
if you get a larger size , it will fit you even after it has shrunk .
what size is yours ?
it was 26 inches around the waist .
here is the one of 29 . will that do ?
i suppose to . i don &apos;t &apos; seem to have other choices but exchange it .
i &apos;m looking for a genuine leather bag .
how about this one ?
the shape does not suit my taste .
please show me another one .
how about this bag made in america ?
this fits me quite well .
i &apos;ll take it .
do i pay by cash or charge ?
cash , please .
good morning , madam .
may i help you with something ?
i &apos;d like to buy some typically chinese toys for the children in the church of our city .
they should be to children &apos;s liking and also easy to take with me .
how do you like pandas ?
they are pearl of the eye to the chinese . both old and young . china is the homeland of the pandas .
they are always the greatest attractions in the zoo .
many children would not go back without toy pandas .
i understand .
in fact we have a wide wide choice of sizes of panda . some are operated on batteries .
the way they walk just like real pandas do .
could you show me several kinds ?
no problem .
how about this one .
it is just reasonable in size . we have eight pandas in a box . and it &apos;s not so difficult to carry .
then i &apos;ll take them .
how much ?
120 yuan fec . the small gift box is complimentary .
here is 150 yuan . keep the change .
thank you . have a nice day !
you , too . bye !
i &apos;m looking for some black shoes for my daughter . she will take part in an evening party .
can you show me what you have ?
sure . we have several different styles you may choose .
how high of a heel do you want ?
not too high . maybe an inch and a half heel would be the best .
in that case , i might have just the pair for you .
look at these.they were made in italy .
the leather is very soft , so toes will not get pinched .
you can tell just by looking at it that was superbly made .
those are beautiful . do you have any in size 6 ?
yes , we do . we also have this same style in dark blue and red .
no , thank you .
i &apos;m just looking for a black pair .
let me go to the back and get them . i &apos;ll be right back .
how long does it last on its batteries ?
it &apos;ll last for eight hours of consecutive use . then you &apos;ll have to recharge the batteries .
is this for plugging into an electrical socket ?
yes .
it is already lunch time when they leave ralph &apos;s garments .
oh i &apos;m starving .
where shall we have lunch , gentlemen ?
any place will do .
a full lunch or just a snack ?
as we &apos;ll have two more factories to visit , i suggest we have a light lunch .
too full a stomach will make me drowsy .
what do you say , mr. yang ?
whatever my boss says .
all right . we &apos;ll pull in at the nancy &apos;s diner .
here we are .
they are ordering .
i &apos;d like to have a big slice of pizza and a blueberry ice cream .
a jumbo hot dog , a submarine sandwich and a sundae for me .
i &apos;ll have a fish burger and an order of french fries .
what kind of drinks do you like ?
a coke for me .
a seven-up .
a sprite , please .
hello , mr. wells .
visiting again , are you ?
yes , calling on some of our distributors .
what &apos;s new in the dinnerware line ?
what &apos;s the trend in styling recently ?
we &apos;ve found a fairly lively demand for fluted bodies . can you take any ?
i imagine we can .
what minimum runs do you want for new shapes ?
can &apos;t you bring it down to 3,000 sets ?
we can consider it . when do you want this delivery ?
the sooner the better .
well , i &apos;ll have something ready for you , such as quotations , catalogs and samples in a week or so .
thank you . you are always considerate .
i &apos;d like you to see the articles we have on display at our office . you will find it a worthwhile visit , i be liver .
i &apos;m sure i will .
when could you spare the time for a visit , do you think ?
oh , let &apos;s see .
say , tuesday or wednesday morning of next week .
good .
i &apos;ll take you along .
what time shall we make it ?
ten o &apos;clock tuesday morning . how &apos;s that with you ?
suits me fine . i &apos;ll be waiting for you at ten on tuesday of next week .
this is our showroom .
i say !
you &apos;ve got some nice things here .
do you get many overseas buyers here ?
yes , quite a few .
they like to keep up-to-date .
you see , we change the display pieces every month .
do you , really ?
this is a quaint set .
what is it ?
a coffee set ?
that &apos;s a porcelain coffee set . maybe a little austere for foreign tastes .
i &apos;m afraid it is .
what would you say is the trend just now in mood or tastes for tableware ?
tea and coffee sets , particularly .
i &apos;d say there is gentle move away from the simple to the baroque .
is that an indication that people have had enough of simple designs ?
no , not at all .
the simple will remain . odd shapes or unusual shapes usually last for a couple of years or so , then give way to something else .
that &apos;s good for business , surely .
it is . this set here , for instance , is popular just now .
it looks nice , don &apos;t you think so ?
very nice . a dessert set : shallow cups , oval plate and saucer .
i think i prefer the round plate and saucer , though .
beautiful colors , shapes , and blending can be worked in glass nowadays .
i agree .
glass always takes a nice polish and looks nice under the lights .
here we are .
mainly glass ware in this section .
ah , that &apos;s the line . flower , fruit , and dish sets .
i &apos;m sure we could work up a good business in that line , and in those vases over there .
well , take a supply of these leaflets .
just a second , i &apos;ll get a set of illustrations for you .
do , please .
i &apos;ll take some back with me to show to our distributors .
fine . thank you .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to change the day of my appointment . i wonder if i could change it to friday ?
no problem , mr. kennedy .
thank you .

three or four days - perhaps longer .
very good. sir .
we &apos;ll be expecting you next monday , the 15th .
good evening , madam . what can i do for you ?
yes , the room is too cold for me .
i feel rather cold when i sleep .
can you turn off the air-conditioning ?
the air-conditioning is already off , madam .
maybe i &apos;m getting a cold .
would you like an extra blanket ?

i think i need to take some medicine .
certainly , madam . i &apos; m be right back . here &apos;s a blanket , and hot water for you . any thing else ?

good night , madam .
i want to make a reservation for a single room .
let me have a look .
yes , we still have a few vacancies left .
do you have a single room with an ocean view ?
yes , we do .
that &apos;ll be fine .
hello . i have a reservation for a double .
what is your last name ?
it is johnson . here &apos;s my driver &apos;s license .
yes . i do have your reservation . how would you like to pay for the room ?
i &apos;d like to put in on my visa .
fine.here is your room key .
here is also a map of our hotel.the swimming pool , the gym and the bar are all located on the first floor .
great .
is our room ready yet ?
yes . if you want to order room service , just press &quot; 0 &quot; on our phone .
and that will connect you with the front desk .
operator , i &apos;ve been trying to get through to the front desk for the last 5 minutes.their line is always busy .
why is it taking so long ?
i &apos;m very sorry to hear that , sir .
during peak hours , the line is often engaged .
shall i ask them to call you back when the line is free ?
yes , thank you .
will you please do me a favor ?
certainly , if i can do it .
i want to go out this evening .
can you look after my baby ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t because it is against our hotel regulations .
but our housekeeping department has a very good baby-sitting service .
thank you for the information .
not at all .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
shall we begin ?
we &apos;re very honored to have mr. li heng and his coach mr. tian bingyi with us tonight .
as we all know , mr. li has just won the badminton championship .
the conference will last 30 minutes .
if you have any questions , do not hesitate to ask them .
mr. li heng , i &apos;m from the local newspaper the weekly post .
i &apos;d like to ask how you feel at the moment .
first , i &apos;d like to give my special thanks to the chinese badminton association and my coach mr. tian .
they &apos;ve arranged this news conference for me .
in the final tonight , i &apos;ve beaten mr. larsen of denmark and win the championship title .
this is a breakthrough , not only to myself , but also to my teammates .
here i must say this medal hanging on my neck is very heavy , i must owe half of the medal to my coach mr. tian .
it &apos;s he who makes this medal possible .
he not only teaches me techniques , but also gives me right directions in my way to grow up .
tell me something basic about tennis .
what do you want to know about ?
how long usually does a match go on for ?
it depends but it usually takes about two or three hours .
so long ?
because usually it is best of three sets sometimes it &apos;s best of five and you have to win six games to win one set and also every game , you have to win four balls . that is why it takes so long .
i hate landing in the sand trap !
now i &apos;m probably going to waste strokes in getting it out .
at least you haven &apos;t landed in the water yet .
i &apos;ve done that on the last two holes .
could you hand me my wedge ?
here you go .
i &apos;ll wait for you to get on the green before i put .
no , you go ahead and put out .
then i &apos;ll go .
no way , mary .
i &apos;m going to let you go first .
i don &apos;t want the pressure of putting first .
say , what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
hm . it &apos;s hard to say .
i like golf a lot , but i guess i like tennis better .
do you play much tennis ?
yes , quite a bit .
how about a game sometime ?
sorry . i &apos;m strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf . i watch them all .
i really can &apos;t tolerate the fiba rules , too much zone .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i am now coaching a high school team , we attended a city tournament last month , and lost all of them .
sorry to hear about that , was it because you don &apos;t have good post players ?
sure . the tallest player on our team is only 1.85m , and they all play zone , we hardly have a chance to drive the lane .
i think the fiba rules should be abolished .
i don &apos;t think so . look at the nba . in the nba , if you have a great post player you can get into the playoffs for sure , and if you happen to have two great post players , you &apos;ll be able to get the nba championship .
too much post play in the game , if you don &apos;t have good post player , you won &apos;t have any chances .
the rockets in 94 , 95 ; the spurs in 99 ; and the lakers last year , they all have the best post players .
what about the bulls ?
don &apos;t forget mj was also a great post player . remember the way he posted up on stockton ?
say , what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
i like badminton a lot .
are you good at it ?
yes , quite good .
how about a game sometime ?
sorry . i just like to watch almost all kinds of ball games - football , baseball , basketball , golf . i &apos;m strictly a spectator .
you mean you never do anything yourself ?
well , i only like to do some jogging in the fresh morning air .
ah , you are an early bird then !
that &apos;ll be 135 yuan .
that can &apos;t be right .
it is .
there &apos;s a surcharge of 20 yuan .
you should explain earlier .
how many ?
there are four of us in all .
there &apos;s room for everyone .
where to ?
tian &apos;anmen square .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m taking a short cut .
but i don &apos;t usually go this way .
it &apos;s faster .
i &apos;m not so sure .
trust me , please .
i know this area very well .
is it going to cost more ?
actually , it will be cheaper .
will you please turn off the air conditioner ?
is it too cold in here ?
a bit .
i caught a cold yesterday .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
let me turn it off .
the charge is supposed to be 15 dollars , right ?
yes , but you &apos;ve made a mistake , sir.this is one , not ten .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
this is my first journey here . i &apos;m not used to the currency yet .
never mind.have a nice trip !
hey , taxi !
yes , ma &apos;am ?
how long does it take to get to the railway station ?
about 25 minutes .
hop in , please .
can you go faster ?
i have to catch the eight o &apos;clock train .
ok . here .
the charge is supposed to be fifteen dollars , right ?
yes , but you &apos;ve made a mistake , madam.this is one , not ten .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
this is my first journey here . i &apos;m not used to the currency yet .
never mind . have a nice trip !
where can i take you today ?
please take me to the china hotel .
sure .
this line is moving so slow .
i know .
it &apos;s always like this when i arrive .
oh , do you come to chicago often ?
unfortunately , yes . our head office is located here .
how about you ?
is it your first time here ?
yes . i &apos;m here on vacation , and .
good evening , sir .
are you mr. nelson cruise from the states ?
ah , yes , that &apos;s right .
glad to meet you , mr. cruse .
i &apos;m the guide from rose tour agency . my name is zhang hua .
hello , i was just looking for the guide .
i &apos;m always at your service , sir .
by the way , did you have a pleasant trip ?
not bad .
but i &apos;ve made too many flights these days .
i could hardly remember how many takeoffs and landings i &apos;ve been through for these three days .
well , shall we go to the hotel right now ?
i &apos;ve already made a reservation for you .
wonderful . i &apos;m eager to take a sauna as soon as possible .
no problem . this way , please . the coach is waiting outside .
fine , let &apos;s go .
how long will you be staying in l.a ?
just a couple of days .
i won &apos;t be needing the luggage in l.a.
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
but we cannot check your luggage through to tokyo if you have more than 24 hours between connecting flights .
oh , i see .
well , i can put them in the airport storage , then .
excuse me .
are you mr. smith ?
no , i &apos;m not .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s all right .
what activities are we going to have tonight ?
we will go to see programs by chinese acrobatic circus .
that &apos;s great !
the programs are marvelous some of them won gold medals in various well-known international acrobatic contests such as in france , hungary , russia and italy .
what kind of things do they have ?
all kinds .
they have magic shows , flying trapeze arts , tightrope walking and even the clowns .
it is a combination of china acrobatic art , chinese gongfu , chinese dance and chinese music .
that &apos;s great ! i am eager to go now .
when and where is it on ?
it is on in poly plaza international theatre at 7 o &apos;clock .
it is already 6 : 30 now . let &apos;s go .
look at the flying trapeze acts . they are scary !
i am afraid that the acrobats might fell down to the ground .
don &apos;t worry about them . they are skillful acrobats , and what is more , they have safety ropes fastened on them .
they are doing a very hard and dangerous job . it is really breathtaking .
look at this program . it is funny and relaxing .
ah , the clown is doing tightrope walking . he is making faces to the audience .
it is not an easy job , isn &apos;t it ?
no , this would also take a lot of skill .
what a special costume he has !
now , look at the girl who is building a pagoda of bowls .
this program won a gold medal in the international acrobatic contest in italy .
oh , this is incredible .
how do you think of the programs tonight ?
the programs are typically chinese . the dance , the music , the costume , the art are so wonderful .
this circus gave me a touch of the chinese culture .
i am glad to hear that .
i &apos;m thinking of a new mask for tonight &apos;s costume dance .
that &apos;s a good idea .
excuse me , please . could you tell me the way to the railway station ?
turn round and turn left at the traffic-lights and then go straight until you see it .
will it take me long to get there ?
no , it &apos;s no distance at all .
it &apos;s only about ten minutes &apos; walk .
thank you very much indeed .
that &apos;s ok .
where can i enjoy the best local food ?
well !
do you like sea food ?
yes , i do .
then i &apos;d like to suggest you try the tung-hai restaurant .
is it very far from here ?
no , you can walk from here .
where is this train bound for ?
it &apos;s going as far as kaohsiung .
will it pass taichung station ?
yes , i think so .
excuse me .
i wonder if you can help me .
i &apos;ll try .
i &apos;m completely lost .
i &apos;m trying to find my way back to the china hotel .
turn right at the second signal light and you &apos;ll see it on your left .
i &apos;m very grateful to you .
how far is it from here to the airport ?
about 40 minutes by car .
thank you .
paula , to be quite frank with you , i think your demands are too high . the 20 % price cut is more than we can give .
david , we sold four times as much last year as two years ago .
i understand what you &apos;re saying — you think we &apos;re selling a lot more now , so we should have much better economies of scale .
that &apos;s fight .
when we started selling for you , your prices were a little high , but we knew the quality was very good .
and your point is ?
my point is that by time , your costs for making each item must have come down a lot .
i understand why you think that &apos;s true , but you &apos;ve forgotten some things .
labor costs have gone up .
but those aren &apos;t costs that you should expect giant george to pay for .
we don &apos;t – and we &apos;ve never passed costs on to you .
so you &apos;re saying your costs have been going up , not down ?
no , in fact they &apos;ve stayed about the same .
but because we &apos;re very happy with our relationship with you , we &apos;re very happy with our relationship with you , we &apos;re willing to offer a 10 % price cut anyway .
i appreciate that , david . i think 10 % is acceptable .
a visitor unexpectedly arrives at m. graber &apos;s office . miss malone has never met him before .
is this mr. graber &apos;s office ?
yes , that &apos;s right . can i be of any assistance ?
i &apos;d like to see mr. grabber , but i haven &apos;t got an appointment , i &apos;m afraid .
mr. graber is engaged at present . may i have your name , sir ?
my name is dudley .
may i ask which company you come form ?
i come from maxton company .
and is there anything particular you want to talk to mr. grabber about ?
yes , i &apos;d like to talk to him about a new product our firm has developed .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. dudley . i &apos;m afraid mr. graber can &apos;t see you today . he &apos;s in the middle of a meeting at the moment .
please leave your card . perhaps he can arrange an appointment for some future date .
would you mind closing the window ?
of course not .
are you feeling cold ?
yes , a bit .
i wonder if it would be very cold in guangzhou when i get there .
no ， the nearer we go to the south , the warmer it will be .
it is still quite warm in guangzhou now .
that &apos;s marvelous .
i was considering buying an overcoat when i arrive in guangzhou .
now i know it &apos;s not necessary .
i don &apos;t think so , either .
so far as i know , the yearly average temperature in guangzhou is about 21 ℃ .
excuse me , may i get off the train halfway ?
yes , but how many days are you going to stay there ?
i &apos;m not sure .
perhaps it will take me at lest three days to do my business .
you know that the period of availability of your ticket is only a days .
if i can &apos;t finish my business within that time , what shall i do ?
in that case , you should buy another ticket if you want to continue your journey .
well , i should try to finish my work as early as possible so that i &apos;ll not pay the double money for the distance .
what &apos;s the matter with you , henry ?
you look unwell , and your eyes are bloodshot .
i didn &apos;t sleep a wink last night .
i had such an awful stomachache that i was on the point of calling for urgent medical aid .
however , after i took some soothing pills , the pain subsided .
how do you feel now ?
i feel much better now , but a feeling of nausea still persists .
is this the first time you &apos;ve had stomach trouble ?
in recent years , i have had occasional attacks of indigestion after eating something my stomach doesn &apos;t agree with , but i &apos;ve never felt such a great pain in my stomach .
that is a rare case for me .
it might have been an attack of appendicitis this time .
i don &apos;t think so .
my elder brother was once operated on for appendicitis , and he told me all the symptoms of this disease .
my case is something quite different .
i think you &apos;d better consult a specialist .
yes , i must go to see the doctor at once .
i hope there is nothing serious .
this is westminster abbey .
it &apos;s one of the oldest buildings in london , and in its architecture you will recognize different styles .
busts and monuments remind us of william shakespeare , walter scott and many others .
to the left you see the house of parliament with the famous clock-tower big-ben .
in the building there is the house of commons and the house of lords .
there , to the left , you see a small street , called downing street .
no. 10 , the last of its ten houses , has always been the residence of the british prime minister .
now , we &apos;re approaching trafalgar square .
this is tower bridge , the most striking of all london bridges .
look !
the bridge is parting in the middle , and the tow halves are moving upwards . a big steamer is passing underneath .
down river stretch the london docks .
excuse me , miss , my wife and i were assigned separate seats.do you have any empty seats together somewhere ?
would you wait a moment , please ?
i &apos;ll check for you .
sir , we have some seats available in the back of the cabin . would that be all right ?
yes , thank you .
may i use the lavatory now ?
sir , could you wait until after we take off ?
we &apos;ll be leaving very shortly .
what would you like for dessert , sir ?
we have a choice of cake or ice cream .
no , thank you .
i don &apos;t need any .
you see , i &apos;m on a diet .
oh , well , perhaps you &apos;d like a cup of tea or coffee instead .
yes , coffee , please .
how long does it take to go from here to chicago by bus ?
about an hour .
do i need to transfer ?
no . it goes straight through .
here is the station . just go down these stairs , and you &apos;ll find the ticket office .
i can &apos;t find my seat .
where is it ?
please show me your ticket .
well , here it is .
it &apos;s in the front of the bus .
what stop is this ?
central park .
would you tell me where to get off ?
all right .
are these yours ?
yes , these are my personal effects .
are you here for business or pleasure ?
for pleasure .
are these yours ?
yes , these are my personal things .
are you here for business or pleasure ?
for pleasure .
do they have any restrictions on the articles carried through customs , mr. smith ?
yes , they &apos;ll check to see if you &apos;re carrying any contraband materials .
and sometimes they &apos;ll ask you to declare things to make a record of the foreign currencies you &apos;re carrying and so on .
are all the belongings subject to duty ?
oh , no .
your personal belongings are not dutiable .
so , you can swim the breast-stroke a little ?
yes , but i can only swim about the length . after that i swim like a brick , down . then i need a lifeguard to rescue me from drowning .
you just need more practice , and a little extra instruction .
some people say that i swim like a fish , because i come here maybe three times a week to practise , and of cause to work out . i only swim in the summer , it &apos;s too cold in the winter .
yes , swimming is a good work-out . it exercises every muscle in my body . it keeps me fit and my body in shape , and i have fun at the same time .
you &apos;re right about that .
it has got to be one of the best all-around exercises in the world . working out this way is fun , too .
without a doubt .
let &apos;s do some warm-up exercises before beginning swimming .
you don &apos;t want to pull a muscle while you &apos;re in the pool , do you ?
of course , you fool !
i pulled a muscle once , and it was very painful .
you &apos;ll get accustomed to it .
you should always start by exercising by the side of the pool to warm up your muscles .
so let &apos;s begin .
one , two , three , four . one , two three , four .
now we &apos;re ready to start .
did you remember to bring a kickboard with you ?
i did . i bough the whole outfit this morning : a kickboard , a pair of goggles , a swimsuit , and a swimming cap , all matching .
i &apos;ve also brought along the inflatable ring that i originally learnt to swim with . as well as a pair of new trunks for you .
thanks . it sounds that you &apos;re well-prepared . let &apos;s get into the shallow end and start the lessons .
i &apos;d prefer to jump in. that way you don &apos;t notice the cold water as much .
so you know how to do the breast-stroke ?
yes . but i can only swim well enough to keep my head above the water and keep myself form drowning .
i think it is the easiest stroke to do .
maybe .
but i prefer this one because it &apos;s the most friendly .
what do you mean by &quot; the most friendly &quot; ?
well , you can keep your head above the water most of the time . so you can swim lengths and talk to your friends at the same time .
ah !
i see what you mean .
if i do the back-stroke , i usually find myself bumping into other people in the pool , because i can &apos;t see where i &apos;m going . and every time i swim the butterfly-stroke , i splash water about so much , it disturbs everyone .
do you ever swim free style ?
i often see people swimming that .
yes , i do . it &apos;s my favorite .
mainly because it &apos;s the quickest , but also because i know the key to doing it well .
i &apos;ve tried to do it , but unsuccessfully . i couldn &apos;t breathe and swim at the same time .
i kept swallowing too much water .
that &apos;s because you don &apos;t know the key to doing it well , controlling your breathing .
you &apos;ll need to master that first , otherwise your swimming will always be like the doggy-paddle . you &apos;ll splash water around a lot , with very little result .
so , it &apos;s because i can &apos;t control my breathing .
i have enough things to think about just trying to swim .
well , i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to start today &apos;s lesson with .
then perhaps in a few weeks i &apos;ll teach you how to dive .
do you mean how to dive into the water from a diving board ?
no. how to dive under the water .
it adds something new to your swimming . it makes it more interesting .
but you &apos;ll have to learn to hold your breath first .
i can &apos;t wait for that .
swimming under the water must be a lot of fun .
you &apos;re right about that .
i can swim under the water for about 50 meters holding my breath . then i come up gasping for air . but it &apos;s great breath . then i come up gasping for air .
but it &apos;s great feeling to be able to do it .
well , let &apos;s start before the pool gets too crowded .
okay .
have you got everything ready , mr. smith ?
we are arriving at the station in ten minutes .
yes , everything is ready .
but i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t carry all the luggage by myself .
don &apos;t worry .
let me help you with the luggage .
tank you very much .
not at all .
it &apos;s what we should do .
tank you for your help .
please accept it .
no , thank you just the same .
we don &apos;t take tips .

how would you like to send the letter ?
i mean , if it is urgent , we can send it by express .
well , actually , there is nothing urgent . please send it as an ordinary mail .
yes , sir .
how about that parcel ?
oh , i must make sure that the parcel reaches home at may 10 .
in that case , i would recommend sending it by air , because it will take too long , say , three weeks to go surface mail from here to china .
very good . i &apos;ll send it by air then .
could you tell me the postage , please ?
it &apos;s $ 1 by ordinary mail .
i think i &apos;d better weight the parcel first . anything else ?
no , thanks .

you should pay extra .
