competition for lands is becoming more serious in our country . we have to accept the need of cities and industry to expand onto traditional farming lands . however , we must set limits on this expansion and establish fair compensation guidelines to use when land is appropriated . soil conservation practices must begin to be implemented as a routine matter . the government must help the farmer by sponsoring research and encouraging proper cultivation techniques . the opening of the domestic agricultural markets to foreign producers has been an unfortunate consequence of the trade imbalance in the industrial sector . farmers are being penalized for industry &apos;s exports . government subsidies and price stabilization programs should be subject to a systematic and periodic review to ensure that the programs are really helping the farmer and not just allowing a few to get rich without producing anything . if a program is not functioning properly , then those financial resources questions now for me , so i &apos;ll conclude my speech and we can begin a substantive discussion .
doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m sure everything will be right again next time you come .
do come again , please .
do come again , please .

it doesn &apos;t matter much . we will not do that .
well , please accept our sincere apologies .
it is very kind of you .

everyone is needed to help on this project-because of its importance in telling people about our society and the work we are trying to do , plus raising money for our other activities.and there is much tot be done to prepare for it.susan jones is in charge of the race itself and will need up to 15 people on race day to help with registration , and crowd and traffic control.rich ashton will man the information booth at the race and says he will need one or two people on the day of the race plus two people with artistic skills to help in him design the booth over the next few weeks . i am in charge of promotion and i have 2000 fliers that need to be posted around town where many people can see them .

as you finish the last of your dessert here tonight , after a wonderfully prepared meal , it is hard to imagine being hungry , to imagine not having had a good meal today , for a few days , for a few weeks.but there are millions of people in the world today who are in just this situation , people who are literally starving to death in a most painful and pathetic way .
i &apos;ve know for some time of this organization &apos;s charitable deeds and progressive ideas and i feel it is an honor to be selected to receive this award . i feel very lucky because i really enjoy my work , even though sometimes it is hard , and sometimes i think of giving it up for something easier.at times you think that you &apos;ve seen it all by now , only to be confronted with a family &apos;s situation that is worse than you ever imagined possible.but then i see a sparkle in an old man &apos;s tired eyes , i feel people &apos;s hearts changing , opening up again and i know this is where i must be , and this is the work i must be doing .
but my daughter , rebecca , is at london university right now .
what time would you like it ?
i think there are two problems that may cause claims : inferior quality and late delivery .

you will certainly benefit in your respective companies by hiring the disabled or handicapped persons.a disabled person undeniably has some physical limitations-maybe this person is confined to a wheelchair , maybe that person has to use crutches to move around , maybe another doesn &apos;t have full use of one or both of his arms.but whatever physical handicap confronts the disabled worker , you rest assured , it is overcome by development in other areas .
until 1911 the palace was off-limits to ordinary citizens , so is also known as the forbidden city .

the aims are firstly to develop and promote peace , understanding , and friendship between countries ;
sure , why not ?
how much is the plane ticket ?
it is free on sunday .
only one thing  if you don &apos;t mind , i have to suggest that i need a guided tour to laoshan , for i was told that it is not only a scenic mountain but also a place famous for taoism . it would be nice if you could make a tour to that place possible .
but judging from our past sales , i &apos;d say you have little need to call on our guarantee . you &apos;ll find this product extremely strong and dependable .

in preparing my remarks for tonight , i began to reflect on one of the finest people i &apos;ve ever know and one of the most successful salesman ever to work here.only the ones of us who have been around for a long time will remember mr. johnson smith . i think this man &apos;s remarkable success can be attributed to some important ideas.first , mr. smith &apos;s perseverance was amazing.he would work all the angles , he would strive to understand the buyer &apos;s needs in great detail and offer them exactly what they were seeking his personal attention and interest showed that this concern was for their welfare and satisfaction , not just making a sale .
would you like some beer ?
all right .
