i am going to o.
i &apos;d like to get some information about the trains for there .
there are express passenger trains and fast through passenger trains for there .
which do you prefer ?
may i know the difference between them ?
it takes you less time to get to your destination by express passenger train than by fast through passenger train .
then i should like to take the express train .
but the express train arrives at your destination at midnight , while the fast through train arrives there in the morning .
oh !
i see .
then i think it is better for me to take the fast through train .
i want to go to wuxi . which train shall i take ?
you may take the shanghai-nanjing through passenger train .
may i take the express passenger train there ?
i was told it takes less time than fast through train .
it does , but it doesn &apos;t stop at wuxi .
the shanghai-nanjing express train goes straight to nanjing without stop on the way .
oh !
i see . thank you .
you are welcome .
can i buy a berth ticket in the train ?
you have bought a hard seat ticket , haven &apos;t you ?
yes , but i want to get a berth , for i &apos;m taking a long journey .
well , i would see if there is any spare berth .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you offer me a hard berth or a soft one .
you know there is some difference in fare between a hard seat and a hard berth , and between a hard berth and a soft berth .
i know the balance .
i am willing to pay for any one .
please wait for a while .
let &apos;s hope you will be lucky .
there is a soft berth in compartment no. three .
oh !
i &apos;m lucky in getting a soft berth .
you are always lucky .

generally speaking , it is not far from the booking office .
you may get the answer if you ask .
by the way , how long is the ticket valid ?
the ticker is valid for d days .
thank you .
you are welcome !
chief conductor i don &apos;t want to get off the train at the next station .

certainly , there are a number of trains from guangzhou to beijing .
which do you prefer , to go straight to beijing or to visit some places of interest on the way ?
are there places of interest on the way to beijing ?
on ! a lot . for example , changsha is famous for its beautiful scenery and ancient tomb at mawangdui .
mawangdui ?
is it the place where a well preserved woman corpse of ancient time was excavated ?
exactly !
i am interested in cultural relics .
i would like to pay a visit there .

please inform us if there is anyone who is going to take your place with the ticket .
thank you very much for your great help .
i was thinking that i would not be allowed to take the train .

you look pale .

cabin no. 3
here we are .

the upper one .
let &apos;s go for a walk on the deck first .
how many ports do we call at on our passage ?
two ports .
the ship is going very fast .
perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour .
nice day , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it couldn &apos;t be better !
a sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this .
i hope it will remain fine all day .
so do i.
is this your first voyage ?
yes . how long does it take to get to haikou ?
the trip takes about 30 hours .
i &apos;m glad it &apos;s not very long .
do you get seasick ?
usually not .
but i don &apos;t know how i &apos;d feel if the ship was pitching and rolling .
in that case , better eat some solid food . don &apos;t drink any liquid .
thank you for your advice .
i see your seat light is on .
may i help you ?
yes , i &apos;m not feeling well .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i have a bad headache .

yes , i &apos;m not feeling well .
what seems to be the problem ?
i have a bad headache .
do you have any aspirin ?
excuse me , sir .
is everything alright ?
my stomach is a little upset . could i bother you for some ice water , please ?
certainly sir .
but can i suggest a glass of warm milk instead ? it will help to settle your stomach down .
no , thanks .
if i could just take a little catnap , i think i &apos;d feel much better .
everyone will finish eating soon , so it will be a little quieter .
until then , why don &apos;t you push back your seat a little ; it will help you to relax .
good idea .
may i have a pillow , please ?
there are a pillow and small blanket stored in the compartment above you , sir .
here , let me get them for you .
thanks very much .
if you feel ill , remember there &apos;s an airsickness bag in the back of the seat in front of you .
thanks again .
i &apos;m sorry to have troubled you .
no problem . i &apos;ll be back with your water in a minute .
thanks very much for your kindness .
excuse me .
yes , sir ?
can i have a glass of water , please ?
certainly . is there anything else that you need ?
i wonder if you have anything for headache . i &apos;m feeling kind of air-sick .

you can such on a candy or pinch your nose gently while breathing out . that shall help .
stewardess , i can &apos;t see the armrest instructions very clearly . i just want to know which buttons should i push when i want to stretch out or adjust my seat .

of course , madam . would you like to have a pillow and a blanket ?

well , you &apos;ve only been on a plane twice , mr. frequent flier .

oh , thank you .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i prefer a window seat .

good . looking out of the window sometimes scares me , so i prefer to be the man in the middle .
there seems to be a delay .
we are supposed to leave at 3 : 20 , but how it &apos;s 3 : 30 .
flight 217 to los angeles will depart from gate 4 .
will all passengers holding tickets kindly proceed to gate 4 at this time ?
thank you .
bob , that &apos;s our flight they &apos;re announcing over the loud speaker .
wait ! what did i do with my boarding pass ?
it &apos;s right there in your pocket . don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s going to be a very pleasant flight .
i &apos;m a little nervous .
i &apos;ve never flown before .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
once you &apos;re up in the air , it &apos;s just like sitting in your own living room .
fasten your seat belts , please .
welcome to flight 217 now departing for los angeles .
what &apos;s the terrible noise ?
the engines .
the crew is warming them up . we &apos;re about to take off .
look ! we &apos;re leaving the ground .
bob , stop clenching your teeth and open your eyes .
we &apos;re already in the air .
look down below and see how toronto looks from the air .
now my ears hurt .
i suppose that &apos;s the atmospheric pressure .
how many things can happen to you in an airplane ?
nothing serious is going to happen to you .
just sit back and relax .
excuse me . do you want headphones for the movie ?
we sure do . by the way , this is a direct flight , isn &apos;t it ?
no , there &apos;s stopover in vancouver .
don , i feel much better now , but what do you suppose we should do if something happens to the pilot ?
the co-pilot will take over .
these big planes always carry two pilots .
we will be arriving at los angeles shortly .
for your own safety , please fasten your seat belts .
bob , did you enjoy the flight ?
it wasn &apos;t that terrible .
excuse me , but where &apos;s my seat ?

the airplane takes off .
one hour later it is flying over the yangtze river . looking at it through the window , a foreigner sitting next to mr yang is apparently amazed by the spectacular view below .
which river is it ?
the yangtze .
no wonder .
hen hao !
you speak chinese ?
just a few words .
are you from the united states ?
yes .
david jackson from phoenix , arizona .
zhonghua yang from beijing .
on a business trip ?
yes . is yours also for business ?
both yes and no .
i &apos;m a businessman but i came as a tourist .
then during the tour i ran into a very interesting chinese businessman and i found we can do a lot of business together .
it &apos;s truly interesting .
i think as china &apos;s economic reform deepens , there will be more opportunities for foreign businessmen .
i feel the same way .
your country has now become a land of opportunity .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;ll come back next month with a detailed proposal .
good for you .
oh , this is my boss mr. kang li .
i prefer a window seat .
oh , you do ?
yes .
good .
looking out of the window sometimes scares me , so i prefer to sit in the middle .
act two
flying west
li li is sitting next to bob in a beijing-bucharest aeroplane .
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen !
welcome to this flight !
it &apos;s 13 : 25 beijing time .
the plane is about to take off in three minutes , so fasten your seatbelts , please !
thank you .
excuse me , may i know your nationality ?
i &apos;m from the states .
you &apos;re chinese , i guess .
yes , you are right .
are you going to romania ?
i mean what &apos;s your destination ?
i &apos;m on my way to london , changing planes at bucharest .
same here .
but why don &apos;t you fly straight to london ?
it &apos;s cheaper going this way .
there &apos;s a 50 % discount for both chinese and romanian passengers for this flight .
is that so ?
that &apos;s fine !
why didn &apos;t you go by beijing-london plane ?
i &apos;m going to travel across europe by train , so as to do some sightseeing on the way .
that &apos;s a good idea , but wouldn &apos;t it be even more expensive than flying ?
staying at hotels and going about sightseeing would cost a lot , surely .
you bet !
but it &apos;s worth it .
yes , when you happen to have the time and money for it .
look !
that &apos;s a lovely bird &apos;s-eye view of the summer palace .
wow !
that &apos;s great !
you &apos;ve been sightseeing beijing , i suppose ?
yes .
i started from san francisco and stopped over at hawaii , tokyo and beijing .
my next stop-over will be at bucharest , then geneva , then paris and finally london .
i guess i &apos;ll be just in time for the next semester .
so you are going to college in england , too .
yes , i &apos;ll be at oxford .
what about you ?
-going to cambridge ?
no . i &apos;m going to london university .
what &apos;s your subject ?
english literature .
and yours ?
european history , of course .
why did you say &quot; of course &quot; ?
what would an american go to college in england for , if not for european history ?
hush ! don &apos;t let my any englishmen hear that !
no , i won &apos;t they are sure to get mad to hear it .
i wouldn &apos;t have said it if you were british .
what &apos;s your name , please ?
my name is li li .
pleased to meet you .
and yours ?
bob bedson .
i &apos;m glad to know you , too .
your first name , bob , must be the shortened form of a christian name ; isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it &apos;s short for robert .
you &apos;ll be in london before i get there , i guess .
yes , i think so .
perhaps we &apos;ll come across each other again in england-one never knows .
yea , maybe we &apos;ll bump into each other in a london street .
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if we do .
as the english saying goes , this is a small world .
what do you want , madam , coffee or tea ?
white coffee , please .
thank you .
and you , sir ?
just a glass of orangeade or lemonade , please , if you have any .
here &apos;s orange juice-will it do ?
it &apos;ll do fine !
thanks a lot .
i suppose you don &apos;t want to be kept awake in the night , but there won &apos;t be any night before we reach our destination .
we are going in the same direction as the sun .
yeah , that reminds me that we &apos;ll have to readjust our watches before we get to bucharest .
yes , putting the time several hours back .
the announcer will tell us when to do it , i think .
the trouble is we &apos;ll have to sleep under a bright sun .
i know .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t dare have any tea or coffee , not before i fall asleep , anyway .
the aeroplane suddenly starts to jerk .
gosh !
what &apos;s happening ?
i think we &apos;ve entered an air-pocket .
yes , we must be flying over some mountainous region , maybe the himalayas .
do you get air-sick something ?
not when it &apos;s a smooth flight .
i &apos;ve never been on any air-journey as rough as this one before .
where have you been by plane ?
i &apos;ve only been flying over the american prairies , the pacific ocean and yellow sea , and never over any mountains before .
well , this may prove to be quite an experience for you .
in case you feel sick and want to throw up , there should be a bag for it in that big pocket at the back of the seat in front of you .
here it is .
you seem to know everything there is to know on a plane .
one would think you &apos;d been an air-hostess or someone like that .
you are nearly right .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;ve been a tourism-interpreter , guide for english-speaking tourists in the last two years .
no wonder you speak very good english , much better english than what most american and british people speak .
you &apos;re flattering me !
in fact , it &apos;s not flattering but joking .
no , i &apos;m not kidding you .
what i mean to say is you speak almost perfect english whereas most english-speaking people speak with all kinds of local accents and quite a lot of people &apos;s grammar is shocking .
really ?
i &apos;m surprised to hear that .
just wait till you are in london , and you &apos;ll see what i mean .
there is a big jerk .
there it goes again !
gee !
that jerk nearly tossed my orange juice to the ceiling .
look !
it &apos;s spilt .
hold on to your glass , bob !
don &apos;t spill it all over the himalayas .
i don &apos;t think the people there like orange juice ; they prefer tea , you know .
how long does the flight take ?
only 40 minutes .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome , sir .
have a nice trip !
excuse , what &apos;s the actual flying time from here to new york ?
about 10 hours .
can you tell me what time we arrive ?
sure .
7 o &apos;clock in the morning , local time .
excuse me , miss . when will we land ?
in 2 hours .
it &apos;ll still be the same day there , i mean , may 14 , won &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s right .
we lose one day when we go from here to the states .
excuse me , miss .
i don &apos;t know how to turn on the reading light .
jut press the switch on your arm rest . by the way , would you like a copy of the latest &quot; guangzhou daily &quot; ?
yes , thank you .
i &apos;m not feeling well , miss .
could i stretch out on those two empty seats ?
no problem .
you &apos;re probably airsick , and i &apos;ll get some medicine for you right away .
thank you very much .
oh , i &apos;ve just realize i don &apos;t have my watch .
i think i much have left it by your airline counter at the airport .
don &apos;t worry , sir . can you tell me what it is like ?
yes . the brand is &quot; omega &quot; .
all right . i &apos;ll have our ground personnel try to find it for you .
i really appreciate your help . this is my card .
that &apos;s fine .
when the plane arrives , we &apos;ll contact you .
miss , can i change my seat for a while ?
i &apos;d like to be a little closer to the .

it could take a few minutes , so why don &apos; you have a seat .
heard any news yet ?
i &apos;m sorry , mr. yu , but we haven &apos;t been able to locate your luggage yet .
it may have missed your connecting flight in detroit . we &apos;re still checking .
if it did miss the connection , will it arrive on the next flight ?
the procedure is to put it on the next flight if there &apos;s room .
it &apos;s very busy this time of year , so i can &apos;t make any promises .
i see . so even if they do find my bags are in detroit , it will be quite a while before they arrive .
i &apos;m not sure , and i &apos;m very sorry about this , mr. yu .
the airline will make sure your luggage is sent to you , as soon as possible .
so what &apos;s the procedure now ?
please give us the name and number of the place you are staying at .

number 12 !

yes . i &apos;d like to store some luggage with you , for about a week .
what do i need to do ?
well , first , how many pieces of luggage have you got ?
just one suitcase , with some samples in it .
how do i pay ?
there is a daily charge for each item . the charge depends on the size of what you want to store .
you don &apos;t charge by weight ?
no .
for this large piece , the charge is 1.50 per day .
is there a penalty if i don &apos;t pick it up on time ?
no . we &apos;ll just charge you for every day the bag is here .
but we take it away if you don &apos;t pick it up within three months .
so i don &apos;t pay now — i pay when i pick it up ?
that &apos;s right .
you &apos;ll have to fill out this form , sir .
thank you , sir .
here &apos;s your claim tag . just hand it in when you come to pick up the case .

mr. william kennedy , jal flight 145 from taipei .
while i &apos;m paging him , could you come to the information desk ?
yes , of course . thank you .
how shall we go to amsterdam ?
i prefer to travel by train .
by train ?
it &apos;ll take us a much longer time than by air .
i &apos;ve never made any long distance travel by train in europe . each time i take a plane , so i want a change .
i believe that &apos;ll be more exciting . i want to see more of the continental landscape .
yes , it &apos;s nice indeed .
the view along the railway is wonderful as the train passes farmland , mountains , rivers and woods , and you &apos;ll see the variation of the landscape .
i feel very excited already . but i &apos;m a little bit worried about the luggage .
don &apos;t worry .
the continental rail system has a perfect luggage service .
the only thing you have to do is to claim your luggage at the destination .
oh , is it ?
when shall we leave ?
i think i &apos;ll be ready in an hour or so .
take your time .
we &apos;ll have to book our tickets first .
hey , george !
what are you doing sitting in the car all by yourself ?
oh , i &apos;m just killing time .
traffic was unusually light , so i came a little bit too early .
why don &apos;t you just go in , then ?
no , i don &apos;t want to embarrass our hostess .
here , this is the september issue of the digest .
why don &apos;t you read it to fill in the time ?
no , thanks .
i &apos;m not the reading type , you know .
it is said that the united states is a country driven by automobiles .
yes , and americans are actually a people living on wheels .
americans like to do business without leaving their cars . wherever you go , you &apos;ll see drive-in banks , drive-in restaurant , drive-in churches and driven-in movies .
if a man visits the untied states with a tourist visa , can he drive in the country ?
so far as i know , he can .
when he drives in the u. s. it &apos;s a good idea to have an international driver &apos;s license , if he is a foreigner and doesn &apos;t have a state license .
does he need to buy a car in order to travel in america ?
i suppose america has some kind of car rental service .
hertz and avis are two largest american car rental companies , which have offices all over the u. s. with counters at most airports and in many international cities , so visitors may want to reserve a car through their travel agent in their own countries .
then how does he pay for his rental service ?
he has to have a major credit card , such as master card , visa , or american express .
without a credit card , he has to pay a very high deposit on the car .
if he doesn &apos;t want to spend a lot of money , he may rent used cars from used car rental companies .
of course , he can also stop a cab on the street , but that &apos;s not easy in many cities , it &apos;s actually easier to call a taxi company listed in the yellow pages of a telephone directory and ask them to send a cab to your door .
thank you very much for the information .
you &apos;re welcome .
the traffic is pretty bad .
it &apos;s bumper-to-bumper all the way .

which kind of food is your favorite ?
&quot; toast sucking pigs &quot; and &quot; wax gourd soup &quot; in guangdong flavour dishes .
i &apos;m glad you like them .
but do you know what &apos;s the main characteristic of guangdong flavour dishes .
no .
would you please give me an introduction of it .
it emphasize on four parts : color , smell , taste and shape , and it can satisfy not only your taste but also your view .

this is my first time in china .
how do you like it here ?
it &apos;s nice .
the people are very friendly .
do you like the food ?
oh yes .

but where are you going ?
i can walk there .
good afternoon .
how &apos;s it going ?
not bad .
how about yourself ?
just so so .

vehicles ahead are moving faster and faster .
oh . thank god !
don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s this way everyday .
for mornings and evenings , this is normal .
we &apos;re moving so slowly .
it &apos;s because of a big construction site .
it &apos;s no wonder that how serious the traffic jam is !
look !
there is a crane ahead that is hanging a large concrete pipe .
damned traffic !

i &apos;m not sure .

let &apos;s hope nobody was hurt .
car accidents are common in the united states .
why is that ?
some motorists don &apos;t drive carefully .
but in china , most of motorists will concentrate their spirit on driving .
in a word , car accidents can &apos;t be completely avoided .
right .
i appreciate your driving skills very much .
thank you .
accidents happen all to often .
how come ?
the traffic rules aren &apos;t enforced .
i see .

this is why the traffic paralysis happened .

great .
your english is great !

then how do you study ?
i listen to tapes . i also practise with foreign passengers .
you are really a man good at taking advantage of opportunities for study .
i &apos;m flattered .
thanks a lot .
you know , i &apos;d have no clue what to do if i lost something important while here in the u.s.
well , if it &apos;s your credit card , call the credit card company right away , so nobody else can use the card .
good idea .
what if i lose something in a public place , like a zoo or something ?
any public place should have a lost and found .
if not , the nearest police station would be the best place to get help .
thanks very much for your help ; i really appreciate it .
it &apos;s already ten o &apos;clock when the show is over .

let &apos;s take a taxi .
taxi !
where to ?
saint paul hotel , please .
is it the one near the beach ?
yes .
get on . here we go .
are you new here ?

yes .
so could you send us downtown tomorrow morning ?
sure thing .

hi , taxi !
please get in .. where to , ma &apos;am ?
the railway station , please .
ok .
here we go .
excuse me . do you think i can get there in time to catch the 11 : 30 train ?
well , let me see .
now it &apos;s 11 : 00 sharp . it &apos;s a long way to go .
if i take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam .
if i take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you &apos;ll have to pay more .
which do you prefer ?
are you sure that i can get here in time if we take the less heavy route ?
generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens .
how much more do i have to pay ?
compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 yuan more .
that &apos;s acceptable .
no one wants to miss a train .

when i was a small boy , i heard my grandfather mention xi &apos;an hundreds of times .
grandpa was of chinese nationality , so i &apos;m a quarter chinese .
i am quite proud of that .
i feel very comfortable to be here in china .
welcome to china .
many overseas chinese come to xi &apos;an to seek their root .
yes . i can see some great wonders here .
can you give me some suggestions ?
the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of xi &apos;an is the terra-cotta army .
besides , the banpo museum , the qianling tomb , the huaqing spring , and the forest of them all .
i &apos;ll visit them all .
is a week &apos;s time enough ?
it just depends .
if you just want to have a rough look , a week is ok .
but to truly understand them , you &apos;ll have to stay months or years .. here we are . shearton xi &apos;an hotel .
how much do i owe you ?
the meter reads 25 yuan .
here is 30 yuan . keep the change .
thank you .

it &apos;s the extra cost for each kilometer you drive on the car . for example , if you drive a sub-compact for one hundred kilometers , you &apos;ll have to pay fifteen dollars for mileage .
oh , i see .
and what is fuel economy ?
that &apos;s how far on a gallon of gas . say , a subcompact can run thirty-five kilometers on one gallon of gas .
one last question . what difference does it make if i get full insurance coverage ?
in that case you wouldn &apos;t be liable for any cost if there &apos;s an accident .
what do you recommend ?
that depends on how you want to use your car .
if you drive it out of town , i would suggest a luxury sedan . it &apos;s safer and more comfortable . but you may want a sub-compact if you use it locally .

oh , the zoo ?
it &apos;s very far away from here !
it takes more than half an hour to get there on foot .
but , don &apos;t you worry , you can take the bus to get there .
you can take the bus no. 16 .
it will take you right there in ten minutes .
thank you ever so much .

turn right at the next corner and go straight on .
thank you very much .
you really save the day for me .
you are welcome .
excuse me.please tell me the best way to the art museum .
a little too difficult .
i write a map for you .

there &apos;s a policeman . let &apos;s go and ask him the way .
all right . excuse me , sir . can you tell us how to get to central park ?
yes . go straight along this street for about 300 yards . then , when you come to a bridge , walk across it and turn left . after you turn . walk for another six or seven minutes , and then .
well , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be able to remember all that .
by the way , is if possible to go there by bus ?
yes , but it doesn &apos;t go directly to the park .
you have to change buses at least twice . better take the subway instead . it &apos;s much less complicated that way , and much quicker .
that &apos;s a good idea . where is the nearest subway station ?

oh , it &apos;s right near here . just walk across the street and go around the corner on rockhill road . walk one block east , take a right at 20th , then walk about half a block . it &apos;s right in the middle of the block .
would you mind drawing me a little map on this piece of paper ?

oh , yes . you &apos;ll see a big hen . you can &apos;t miss it .
thanks a lot .
excuse me , sir .

ask the driver to let you off at garden road . the park is only a short walk from there .
you can &apos;t miss it .
thanks . i really appreciate your help .
after the man left .
young man , i couldn &apos;t help but overhear your conversation just now .
i think that gentleman must be confused , because the directions he gave you were all wrong .
if you follow them , you &apos;ll end up at the zoo .

walk with me .
i &apos;m heading in the direction where you &apos;ll catch the bus you want .

in a big maze
scene 1 outside the airport
li li has just arrived in london and walks out of the airport .
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to london university ?
sorry , i don &apos;t know exactly where it is , but i know it &apos;s far from here .
you &apos;ve got a long way to go , i &apos;m afraid .
why don &apos;t you take a taxi ?
there are plenty of them round here .
i don &apos;t need a taxi just now .
i &apos;ve just left my luggage at the airport because i want to find my way in london first , and i &apos;ll come back to fetch it when i &apos;ve found out where to live .
i see .
it &apos;s very sensible of you , to be sure .
since you want to know your way about this big city , you &apos;d better ask that man in airport uniform by the gate .
all right . thank you .
excuse me , will you please tell me how to get to london university ?
but the university buildings are all over the city .
it depends on what department of the university you want to go to .
haven &apos;t you got any definite address ?
i just want to go to the university registry .
here &apos;s the address .
what part of london does it say ?
it says here : n. w. 5 .
that &apos;s northwest london .
i &apos;ll tell you what to do : go and jump on that coach over there .
it will take you to boac general office , and you &apos;ll find yourself in the center of the city .
i can ask my way from there .
thank you very much !
scene 2 outside boac office
excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the northwest part of london ?
sorry , no idea .
london is such a big place , and i &apos;m from the east end .
why don &apos;t you go and ask a cop ?
pardon ? what &apos;s a cop ?
don &apos;t you know what a cop is ?
it &apos;s another name for the policeman .
but for goodness sake , don &apos;t call any of them &quot; cop &quot; to his face !
why not ?
it &apos;s slang , you see .
they are referred to as &quot; cops &quot; only behind their backs .
thank you for reminding me .
are there may policemen in the london streets ?
there always seem to be quite a lot about when you don &apos;t need them , but when you want to call the police , guess what happens !
i suppose when you want to call the police , none of them can be found .
am i right ?
ha ! ha !
that &apos;s exactly what i was going to say , and you took it right out of my mouth .
clever girl !
but how did you know ?
all the policemen in the world are like that , aren &apos;t they ?
yes , you &apos;re absolutely right .
are you chinese , deary ?
now it &apos;s my turn to ask : how do you know ?
a little bird told me .
look !
-there &apos;s a cop at the corner ; go and ask him before he walks away !
be quick !
thanks a lot !
bye !

i seem to have gotten lost .
there are many ways to get to the imperial theater .
oh , please tell me the fastest way .
i &apos;m very late as it is .
well , in that case , keep going straight and when you get to the second stop light , cross the street and turn left .
walk about three blocks , and you &apos;ll see the imperial theater on the right .
it &apos;s a big building , so you can &apos;t miss it .
of course , there is a short cut , but if you &apos;re not acquainted with american , it may turn out to be longer in the end .
oh , i think i understand .
thank you .
. let &apos;s see . go straight ahead and turn left at the first stop light . or was it right after the second stop light ?
. oh , dear !
. sir !

yes , madam .
what &apos;s wrong ?
something has gone wrong with my car .
let me see .
how long do you think it &apos;ll take to fix it ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
if we can find the problem right away , we can fix it soon .
otherwise it would take hours .
when can i get it back ?
i &apos;m not sure now .
i &apos;m trying to find the problem .
will you get it fixed today ?
i don &apos;t find any serious problems , so we should have it ready by four at the latest .

what &apos;s the best time to take the subway ?
try to avoid the rush hour , 7 : 00-9 : 00 a.m. and 3 : 00-6 : 30 p.m. since peak hours are prime time for pickpockets . and you might not get a seat easily during the peak hours .

ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one . it &apos;s free of charge .

here comes the train .
be careful ! subway doors open and close automatically .
well , it &apos;s now crowded as we expected , isn &apos;t it ?
no , but it will be soon .
look , there &apos;re two empty seats over there . let &apos;s get them before somebody else does .
yes , let &apos;s !
now let &apos;s make ourselves comfortable since we &apos;ve got quite a way to go .

very much and i found it very funny , too .

i was down at the lilan station at 7 : 30 , i guess that was a bad time to travel.when a train pulled in i was simply swept in by the rush of people from behind .
oh , poor you !
but did you manage to find a seat ?
that was out of the question .
the train left the station before i was able to get back my breath .
i planned to get off at the bridge station for a visit , but i found myself landed at an entirely new one .
so you overrode your station .
that &apos;s right , and it took me half an hour to get on a train back .

sure .

good morning .

scene 1 in the british consul &apos;s office
good morning !
i &apos;ve come to apply for an entry visa .
here &apos;s my passport , and here are the papers .
sit down , please .
what do you want to go to britain for ?
i &apos;m going to take a course in electronic computers in england .
this is the letter of acceptance from the university .
and this one is my visa-application .
the rest are all certificates .
but you still have to fill in an application form .
here you are .
you can take them home to fill out , if you like .
thank you .
how long do i have to wait for the visa ?
we &apos;ll send your papers to the immigration office right away , but it usually takes months , even years to get a reply .
but i must get there in the summer vacation , before the autumn term starts .
couldn &apos;t you ask the immigration office to grant the visa as noon as possible ?
don &apos;t worry !
foreign students all get their visas in time .
it &apos;s people who might want to make a living in britain that we try to stop .
yes , i can quite understand .
you have your unemployment problems and all that .
i can assure you , the whole purpose of my going over to study is to come back afterwards to do my bit in the modernization of china .
well , are there any other formalities ?
no , not for the moment .
i &apos;ll let you have the forms by tomorrow morning .
see you tomorrow !
part two
a smart girl goes west
act one
here she comes again !
a young chinese woman enters the british consul &apos;s office .
good morning !
hello , miss li !
i &apos;m so glad to see you !
oh , no , you aren &apos;t !
i &apos;ve been here hundreds of times for the visa , so you couldn &apos;t possibly be glad to see me again .
but i &apos;m really glad to see you this morning .
i was just going to ring you up to let you know the visa had been granted at last .
really ?
i can hardly believe my ears !
do you realize i &apos;ve been waiting for nearly six months by now ?
actually , that &apos;s not very long , compared with the time it took many other visa-appliers .
i told you long ago that it might take a long time , didn &apos;t i ?
yes , now i see what you mean .
this is british efficiency , i suppose ?
no , let &apos;s not put it that way , please !
shall we say it &apos;s the efficiency of the british immigration office ?
the trouble with then is they seem to think anyone who goes to britain will stay put there .
but , miss li , with so many immigrants in britain already , the immigration office has to take precautions , you know .
to be frank , if i were somebody who wanted to stay abroad for good , i would certainly not choose britain .
why not ?
i should think england is a rather nice place to live in , with its mild weather-not very cold in winter , and never too hot in summer .
as far as i know , the living cost there is very high , while the sweden and many other western countries .
that , i must admit , is true .
besides , england is well-know for its bad weather .
i hear the sun hardly ever shines there .
yes , we have maritime climate in the british isles .
it can &apos;t be helped .
if i wanted to have a good time . i wouldn &apos;t like to live in england either .
in that case , would you go to new york instead of london ?
yes , or paris , or venice , or vienna .
what puzzles me now , my dear young lady , is why you should have applied for a british visa after all .
oh , the answer is quite simple : i happen to be a student of english , you see .
and i &apos;ve always wanted to get an m.a. degree in english language in england since my school-days .
if i may say so , miss li , you must have been a most ambitious girl .
yes , i was .
in fact , i still am .
as i &apos;m so deter-mind to get that degree , i &apos;ve decided to go to london university .
i see !
no wonder you speak such fluent english .
thank you .
now you see why i must go to england even if it rained everyday there .
well , you could go to america for the degree , to learn american english , see ?
and i wouldn &apos;t like to speak with an american accent .
the reason is very simple again : i just don &apos;t want to learn american english , see ?
and i wouldn &apos;t like to speak with an american accent .
but nowadays quite a lot of people all over the world prefer to speak with an america accent .
it seems to have become a rather smart accent , especially among young people .
haven &apos;t you noticed it ?
adopting west american accent
yea . i &apos;m a smart girl that speaks with a smart accent .
ain &apos;t you a smart guy , too , mr. cowboy ?
you bet !
to tell you the truth , the american accent gives me pins and needles sometimes .
the americans seem to speak through their noses , while i prefer speaking with my mouth .
how strange ! i thought the english spoke with their tongues-that &apos;s why they are so proud of &quot; the english tongue &quot; ; isn &apos;t that so ?
how strange !
i thought the english spoke with their tongues-that &apos;s why they are so proud of &quot; the english tongue &quot; ; isn &apos;t that so ?
i say , with you puns and your big vocabulary , you &apos;ll make a great linguist , to be sure .
well , here is you passport , and the visa is stamped on one of the pages .
thank you very much .
sun lin , another chinese student , enters .
good morning !
what can i do for you ?
. but you &apos;ve been here recently , haven &apos;t you ?
yes , i was here only yesterday morning .
my name is sun lin .
here are the forms you gave me to fill out , and i &apos;ve done it .
are you all right , i wonder ?
thank you .
let &apos;s have a look . yes , they are properly done .
that &apos;s good ; i &apos;ll send them to london with the rest of your papers .
i must go now .
thank you for your help during the last six months .
six months !
gosh !
does one have to wait as long as all that ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid so , and sometimes even longer than that .
but if also have to wait for such a long time , the term will have started long before i get to london .
that would be too bad !
couldn &apos;t you do something about it ?
as i &apos;ve told you already , i &apos;m not in the position to promise anyone anything .
all i can say is : foreign students would get visas in time , if they apply for them in time .
good !
that &apos;s all i wanted to know .
now , miss li , you can go and get your yellow paper ready for the journey .
excuse me , what &apos;s &quot; yellow paper &quot; ?
李小姐 ， 现在你可以去办旅行黄皮书了 。
it &apos;s just another name for a health certificate .
you , too , will have to be inoculated for the yellow paper when you &apos;ve got the visa .
if you have any other questions , just ask miss li .
she &apos;s a walking dictionary .
really ?
miss li must be a great scholar then .
no , not quite .
she &apos;s just a very smart chinese girl .
good morning . what can i do for you ?
is there a ship sailing for hamburg next week ?
yes , there is . the s.s. newcastle is sailing for hamburg from southampton next wednesday .

just show your boat tickets at the gate and they &apos;ll let you pass .
if there should be any last-minute change in the sailing time , we &apos;ll contact you by telephone .
fine .
and is there a place here where i can get traveler &apos;s cheques ?
yes , right over there at that counter , sir .

one moment , please .

i would like some wine .
yes ? what will it be ?
i hate to admit this . i really don &apos;t know too much about wine .
may i make a suggestion ?
yes , of course .
why don &apos;t you consult our bartender ?
he &apos;ll be glad to give you some suggestions .
that will be ok as long as it isn &apos;t too expensive .
good evening . ladies and gentlemen .
a table for four ?
you want to sit at a table or at the bar ?
well , i don &apos;t fancy a bar stool .
somewhere not too near the band .
this way , please . will this do , ladies and gentlemen ？
it &apos;s fine .
what may i offer you , ladies and gentlemen ?
i don &apos;t know what i want . i &apos;m not really a drinker .
an aperitif or some white wine ?
um . a highball .
i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t drink at all .
do you serve soft drinks ?
certainly , madam .
we have a variety of soda water and fruit juice .
what kinds of fruit juices do you have ?
orange juice , grape juice , pineapple juice , coconut water , and watermelon juice .

i &apos;m sorry , sir .
as you see , we &apos;re very full tonight .
but i &apos;m give you first small table available . is that all right ?
i suppose it will have to do .
now , what can i make for you , sir ?
whisky sour , please .
would you like your whisky with ice or without ice ?
certainly without ice .
ice will spoil the taste .
very good , sir .
here &apos;s your drink , sir .
cheers .
fine . will you have one yourself ?
thank you just the same .
as a bar policy we are not allowed to drink on duty .
i see .
just at that moment the guest drops the glass carelessly and breaks it .
oh , darn . look what i &apos;ve done .
it doesn &apos;t matter , sir .
have your clothes been dirtied ?
no . i &apos;m terribly sorry . i &apos;ll pay for it .
that &apos;s quite all right . you didn &apos;t do it on purpose , after all . you can compensate for it by half the price .

good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
we are open to everyone-guests and locals alike .
can our two children come in to listen to the music for a moment ?
how old are they , madam ?
tom is twelve and elizabeth is eight .
i &apos;m afraid not , madam .
our licensing . laws are quite strict .
nobody under 18 years of age is allowed in a bar .
well , it &apos;s the same at home , but we thought since they &apos;re on holiday , it won &apos;t be any harm .
we won &apos;t order them anything strong .
maybe they will just dance a bit .
it &apos;s our last night in china .
i &apos;m really sorry . i &apos;d like to oblige , but you see my difficulty .
maybe no one will notice .
well , it &apos;s also our duty to check , madam .
now how about a drink in the lounge outside ?
if you sit here , you can see the band and hear the music as well .
but no dancing , huh ?
regretfully not .

good evening , sir .
would you like to order some wine with your meal ?
um , yes .
the wine list , sir .
thank you .
you certainly have a very extensive cellar .
what would you recommend ?
i think that a chablis or a muscatel would go very well with your oysters .
we &apos;d like one which is very dry .
then i would recommend the muscatel .
fine . we &apos;ll take a half bottle of that then .
and with your steak ?
let &apos;s see , do you have a very full-bodied wine which is not too fruity ?
our own house wine which we import specially , the chateau de lescours , would be very suitable .
it is a burgundy with a rich but delicate body which is not too dry .
that sounds just right .
we &apos;ll have a full bottle of that .
certainly , sir .
just a moment , please .
good evening , sir .
are you expecting anyone ?
no , just me .

good evening , gentlemen .
what &apos;s your pleasure this evening ?
stay on the same -a scotch highball and a sirloin steak .
the guest is having the dinner . another guest comes over to him with a long umbrella under his arm and a heavy suitcase in hand .
excuse me , sir . do you mind putting these outside the restaurant or giving them to me and i &apos;ll certainly take good care of them ?
no , i never like to leave my personal belongings with others .
i &apos;ll finish the dinner as quickly as possible .
they won &apos;t stand in others way .
polite-smile on the face
but your umbrella is a bit too long and maybe it &apos;ll bump into the others or knock down the dishes .
then it maybe spoil your dinner .
is that your privilege to ask me to do so ?
it &apos;s not my privilege , but it &apos;s my duty .
our restaurant always remains a good reputation-we have a good clientele here .
we &apos;ll take a good eye on your things and return them to you immediately when you &apos;ve finished your dinner .
a smile comes over his face .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll refuse your kindness .

do you need anything else ?
not now .
the waiter goes into the room with the beer a moment later .
waiter , is this martini ?
it doesn &apos;t taste right to me . it &apos;s too weak .
really .
i saw the bartender fix it with the best brands of gin and vermouth .
but still i &apos;ll change some new one for you if don &apos;t think it strong enough .
thank you . now we &apos;d like to have some good italian spaghetti .
all right .
a few minutes later , the waiter comes with a tray with some spaghetti , cheese and egg rolls on it .
surprised
oh , why cheese and egg rolls .
are they on the house ?
no , they &apos;re just on the order .
another guest
yes , it &apos;s a little something that i ordered in the morning .
now , i &apos;ll sign the bill .
sorry , sir . only the gentleman who occupies the room has the right to sign the bill .
all right , let me sign for it .
good evening , sir . what can i do for you ?
i &apos;m expecting a friend but he hasn &apos;t turned up yet . did he leave a message ?

thanks .
the bill you sent me is incorrect , waiter !
oh , dear , what &apos;s the matter , sir ?
i was overcharged $ 9.9 for the meal .
overcharged ?
it &apos;s very strange .
yes , it has been the second time .
really ?
i must apologize if it &apos;s true .
you asked to see me , mr. brown ?
yes , i did .
i &apos;m very angry at the way i have been treated .
could you tell me what exactly is the matter ?
my steak is too rare . i can &apos;t eat it .
but when i complained to your waitress she just ignored me .
i &apos;m very sorry , sir . she doesn &apos;t understand english very well . she should have changed your steak .
but she didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s been a misunderstanding , sir .
i &apos;ll have the steak returned to the kitchen right away .
that &apos;s more like it .
is that it , sir ?
yes .
well . i hope you enjoy your dinner .
i &apos;ll try .
what happened to my order ?
i &apos;ve been kept waiting for over half an hour already .
i &apos;m very sorry , sir .
i will ask right away .
well , please hurry up . i can &apos;t wait much longer .
i have a train to catch .
one moment , please .
i &apos;m sorry in have kept you waiting , sir . your order will be here in a minute .
o.k.
oh , here is your order .
once again , our deepest apologies .
waiter , may i see you for a moment ?
yes .
what &apos;s the problem ?
is this my meal ?
what did you order ?
the fried scallops .
there must be some mistake .
those are fried oysters .
i thought so .
will you keep the oysters , or should i get the scallops for you ?
the scallops , of course .
that &apos;s what i ordered .
i see .
just a minute , and i &apos;ll get your order for you .
waiter , could you please come over here ?
yes .
what can i do for you ?
i &apos;d like to change the soup you gave me .
why ?
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
look , there &apos;s a fly in my soup !
it wasn &apos;t there when i served it to you .
well , there &apos;s one now .
if you don &apos;t change this , i &apos;m going to make a scene .
alright . just relax . i &apos;ll take care of it .
28 . complaining about the food
seeing the guest beckoning to him , the waiter goes over .
is there anything that matters , sir ?
yes , have a look at the shrimp . it &apos;s stale .
oh , i &apos;m awfully sorry to hear that .
such a thing seldom happens in our restaurant because we always have the fresh shrimps from the market every day .
i &apos;ll go to the kitchen and report it to the chef .
it &apos;s of no use at all . i &apos;ve not enough time to wait for it .
i &apos;m terribly sorry . do you mind trying something else ?
then bring me a steak .
remember to have it well done this time . i don &apos;t have extra time to change this and that .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll satisfy you .
better this time .
thank you .
.
please try the shrimp this time .
surprised
why , i &apos;ve canceled it . but still i &apos;ll try .
yes , this is good .
the chef said this is well done and the above one is medium .
but in fact they were the same shrimp today .
and he also asked me to tell you it was on the house .
thank you very much .
i feel sorry for the words i &apos;ve just said .
not at all .
making apologies
waitress , there is no ashtray on the table .
we &apos;re sorry , sir .
smoking in public places is forbidden by the regulations laid done by our municipal government .
if you want to smoke , please go to the lounge .
i do apologize for causing inconvenience to you .
i see .
in this case . i &apos;ll restrain myself from smoking .
by the way , this glass is cracked .
i &apos;m really sorry i didn &apos;t notice that .
i &apos;m going to change it right away .
could i have some toothpicks , please ?
certainly , sir .
i &apos;ll bring you some .
we &apos;ve booked a table for eight .
the reservation is under the name of johnson .
yes , one moment please .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s no table reservation marked in that name , sir .
but i phoned myself only this morning and i was promised a window table .
i see .
there must be some mistake , sir .
ah , we could give you a pleasant table in the blue room , though . i &apos;m afraid it isn &apos;t a window table .
well , i suppose we &apos;ll have to manage with that , but i must tell you i &apos;m disappointed with your service .
i &apos;m very sorry indeed that this should have happened , sir .
but i assure you we will make every effort to make your evening here a pleasant one .
there &apos;s no ashtray on the table !
i &apos;m very sorry , sir . i &apos;ll bring you one .
could i have some matches , please
certainly , sir .
i &apos;ll bring you some .
waiter .
this isn &apos;t what i ordered !
i &apos;m very sorry , sir .
what was your order ?
i ordered a shrimp curry , not beef curry !
i see sir .
i &apos;ll bring you some at once .
here is the grilled beefsteak .
the grilled beefsteak ?
i &apos;m afraid you are mistaken .
let me check up .
well , there is no mistake .
this is the very dish you ordered .
but .
well , to be frank , i don &apos;t really care for it .
can i have it changed ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
once it &apos;s served , it &apos;s served .
that &apos;s all right .
waiter , i asked for rare roast beef .
yes ?
this is well-done .
shall i take it back ?
please do .
i don &apos;t like it this way .
29 . a guest hard to deal with
i wonder how you cooked the meat . it &apos;s just like old leather .
i can &apos;t chew it. it &apos;s hard enough to break every tooth .
sorry , sir . let me take it back and change a new one for you .
no , just set it aside . i think you &apos;ll do more harm than good .
i &apos;d like to change the order . bring me ham steak instead .
yes , sir .
the waiter brings the guest the ham steak a few minutes later .
please , sir .
waiter , look what you &apos;ve done .
you spilt the broth over my dress . it &apos;s terrible .
i &apos;m very sorry , ma &apos;am .
maybe i can sponge it with a little warm water .
no , you &apos;re not a laundryman , you &apos;ll only make it even worse .
i want to speak to the manager .
i do apologize for this unfortunate incident , madam .
i think you would take trouble to have it dry cleaned and send the bill to us and we &apos;ll pay for that .
or if you don &apos;t mind , we can have it cleaned and ironed in our laundry .
just forget it .
we don &apos;t want to put ourselves in trouble . but i &apos;d like to say it leaves mush room to make guests satisfied .
thank you for your good advice . we &apos;ll certainly improve our service .

i don &apos;t particularly care for eating with my jacket on .
perhaps you &apos;d like to sit over there in the corner ?
there &apos;s less draught .
that &apos;s a good idea .
thank you very much .
mr. henry bakon and mr. john snow feel very hungry after a whole day &apos;s sightseeing in beijing .
knowing that there &apos;s an excellent restaurant nearby , they decide to dine there .
as they know , it &apos;s necessary to reserve a table in advance for dinner , so mr. bakon is ringing to book a table .
say , snow , i &apos;m feeling very hungry .
so am i.
but where shall we eat ?
one of my chinese friends told me other day that there &apos;s an excellent restaurant near here . why don &apos;t &apos; we have our dinner there ?
good idea !
i know chinese restaurants serve a variety of delicious food .
oh , it &apos;s dinner time now. we &apos;d better phone to book a table .
mr. bakon is phoning the restaurant .
good evening , this is the hongdu restaurant . can i help you ?
good evening . i &apos;d like to book a table for two .
certainly . your name , sir ?
henry bakon .
yes , sir .
we have a table for two by the window . you can enjoy the scenery while eating .
sounds great , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome . goodbye .
goodbye .
mr. bakon and mr. show are now at the hongdu restaurant .
good evening , sirs .
may i help you ?
i made a reservation for two . my name &apos;s henry bakon .

the waiter shows them to their table .
sit down , please .
what would you like . chinese food or western food ?
we prefer chinese food .
what dishes do you have in mind ?
none yet .
you see , this is the first we have come to your restaurant . we have no idea what dishes you serve here .

of course . here you are .
i &apos;d like the jade beef and the eggs with oysters .
what about you , mr. snow ?
i &apos;ll have the eggs with oysters , too .
what poultry dishes do you serve ?
we have roast duck , the real roast duck ; paper-spiced chicken and deep-fried pigeon .
i &apos;d like to try roast beijing duck .
roast beijing duck is very well-know even in our country .
a friend told me before i came to china that i ought not to leave beijing until i tasted roast beijing duck .
that &apos;s true .
you &apos;ll never forget it once you &apos;ve tasted it .
what &apos;s today &apos;s speciality ?
chrysanthemum flower .

finely chopped shrimp . mixed with egg white and pork fat .

i &apos;d like rice .
what would you like , mr. snow ?
rice is o. k.
what else would you like to order ?
nothing at the moment , thank you .
not at all .
by they way , we are learning to use chopsticks . could you show us how to handle them ?
no problem , sir .
you hold the upper sticks between you thumb and first two fingers , while keeping the lower sticks stationary with your fourth finger ; hold the sticks with one third above the hand and two thirds below . then try to clack the tow ends together , like this . yes , you &apos;re learning fast .
thank you . we hope to master it soon .
i &apos;m sure you will .
while eating chinese food , use your right hand for the chopsticks and your left hand for holding the bowl . contrary to your custom , in china you are expected to bring the bowl to your mouth instead of leaving it on the table .
many thanks for your help .
my pleasure .
i think chinese food is perfect in colour , aroma and taste .

all right ?
okay .
your roast beijing duck , gentlemen .
could you show us how to eat this dish ?
certainly , sir . first , hold a pancake in our left hand and using a section of raw scallion as a brush , paint a few splashes of bean sauce on the pancake . like this .
next , place the scallion in the center of the pancake , and with your chopsticks add a few pieces of duck skin .
finally , roll the pancake up and enjoy !
let us have a try .
is that right ?
yes .
perfect !
oh , so delicious !
so tender and crispy !
i &apos;ve never tasted anything like that .
how is it made ?
the preparation is a bit complicated .
let me give you just a brief introduction .
first , ducks must be split open , dressed , scalded and dried .
when roasting , it &apos;s better to use fruit tree branches as firewood to lend more flavor to the duck .
besides , a steady temperature must be maintained in the oven and ducks must be rotated so that they can be evenly roasted .
how long does it take to roast the ducks ?
about 50 minutes .
and when the skin turns crisp and golden brown , the duck is done .
how interesting it is !
we &apos;ll invite more friends to taste the dish next time .
good evening , sir .
here is your menu .

i would recommend the shredded pork with garlic sauce , the sautéed chicken cubes with chili and peanuts , twice-cooked pork slices and the crucian carp with chili bean sauce .
so it seems all sichuan dishes are hot and spicy .
i myself do like hot food , but my niece does not like hot food .
could you recommend some dishes which are not hot or which are not very hot ?
certainly , sir .
actually , sichuan food is not always hot .
even the dishes i mentioned just now are not very hot .
apart from hot food , we have sweet and sour food , light taste food , multi-flavor food , etc .
good . your recommendations ?
the sweet and sour pork chops , the steamed carp , the steamed preserved cabbage and pork and the duck with chinese caterpillar fungus .
the duck with chinese caterpillar fungus ?
it is a kind of health food , isn &apos;t it ?
a chinese friend of mine once told me .
you many say so .
anyway , caterpillar fungus is one of the traditional chinese tonics . it &apos;s good for your health .
sounds so good .
we &apos;ll take this , as well as the sweet and sour pork chops. and the shredded pork with garlic sauce .
very good .
by the way , the fish with chinese sauerkraut is one of the specialties of the house . but it &apos;s a bit hot .
would you like to try it ?
all right . i &apos;ll have it . thank you .
with pleasure .

sunny boy , i &apos;m not in the mood to eat or laugh .
that &apos;s too bad !
what &apos;s wrong ?
didn &apos;t you hear me quarrelling with jack half an hour ago ?
never mind !
you two will make up again very soon , i &apos;m sure .
but it &apos;s really serious this time .
he actually banged the door in my face .
how dare he !
you must have said something to hurt him badly , didn &apos;t you ?
i can &apos;t remember exactly what i said .
well , i hope i &apos;ll never see him again !
liar !
you are in love with jack , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah , that &apos;s the trouble .
i &apos;ll go home for christmas and forget all about him .
that &apos;s not a bad idea .
it will do you both a lot of good .
absence makes the heart grow fonder .
no .
out sight , out of mind .
let &apos;s bet on it !
you &apos;ll see who is right .
i guess i &apos;ll lose .
i &apos;m sure you will .
and he &apos;ll miss you very much , too .

i &apos;m afraid you can have beef steaks if you don &apos;t mind .
but i &apos;m not much of a beef eater .

in this case , you may try some shrimps .
that &apos;s a good idea .

i know you can hold your liquor , so i &apos;ll get you some more .

this is my first time to come to a chinese restaurant .
could you tell me the different features of chinese food ?
generally speaking , guangdong food is a bit light ; shanghai food is rather oily ; and hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste .
chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable .
they &apos;re good in color , flavor , and taste .
did you enjoy the meal ?
it &apos;s the most delicious dinner i have had for a long time .
i &apos;m so glad you like it .

today &apos;s food is very delicious , thank you for treating me .
this seafood dish is so delicious . it tastes like shrimp and some kind f fruit . what &apos;s in it ?
you &apos;re right ; it &apos;s shrimp , and the fruit is pineapple .
how do you like the sweet and sour fish ?
it &apos;s real gourmet food-really melts in your mouth .
here , we &apos;ve finished this side of the fish , so let me turn it over .
wait second , tom . it &apos;s bad luck to turn the fish over .
we have a superstition here that if you turn the fish over , maybe the next boat or airplane you &apos;re on will turn over too !
well , i don &apos;t think i want that to happen ! thanks for telling me .
so , do you gentlemen follow any sports ?
yes .
howard and i watched a couple of basketball games from america last weed .
michael jordan is really unbelievable !
he &apos;s a very skillful player , and a clever businessman too .
he must make much money on those tennis shoe endorsements he does .
right . and i hope we can do the same with our latest line of sports equipment . by we way , can you tell me what the latest news is on our tennis rackets ?
we &apos;ve made some modifications to the handle , so it &apos;s easier to hold on to .
we &apos;ve also designed a whole new look for the racket .
these new rackets are going to be top of the line .
i believe the new look will make the customers notice them more , and the high quality will keep them happy .
maybe we can get jimmy connors to endorse them !
that would be great , but let &apos;s not get carried away .
when will i see the rackets ?
we are going to the factory tomorrow morning . you &apos;ll see them and a few other products .
let &apos;s drink a toast to the new rackets - bottoms up !
another 20 minutes has passed .
have one more fish ball , mr. bowen .
no , thanks .
it &apos;s great , but i &apos;m afraid i have to watch my weight .
mr. dewey ?
i wish i could have more , but i &apos;m really full .
thank you .
an attendant puts some hami melon on the table .
then , have some hami melon .
please help yourselves .
mmm , it tastes great !
it &apos;s the best melon in china .

no , thank you .
i prefer tea without milk or sugar .
i &apos;m greedy .
look ! i have milk and three lumps of sugar in my cup of tea , and i never put on weight .
we drink green tea instead of black tea in china , and never add milk or sugar .
green tea ?
don &apos;t breathe a word of it to mrs. west , or she would be rushing over to chinatown to get it specially for you .
i know you wouldn &apos;t want her to do that .
of course not .
thank you for reminding me .
sandwich ?
these are tomato sandwiches , and those are cucumber ones .
thanks .
but how about yourself ?
i &apos;m going to slice this loaf .
i like bread and butter .
pass me the butter , will you ?
here you are .
and here is jam for you , since you keep slim no matter what you eat .
lucky girl !
thanks . i had a letter from my pa and ma this morning .
they have just got home from a trip to asia .
i wish i could afford a trip to china to see the great wall .
well , where there is a will , there is a
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll be listening to a famous professor , becky brown &apos;s lectures on shakespeare in a chinese college one of those days .
it &apos;s sweet of you to say so , but that could only be my daydream .
oh ! where &apos;s my hand-bag ?
i must have left it in the dining-room .
she is about to run off .
come back , becky !
look !
you have been sitting on it all the time .
tell me , do you have any other name beside becky ?
no . i &apos;ve been called becky ever since i was a kid .
why did you ask ?
oh . you remind me of somebody , that &apos;s all .
scene 1 in the dining-room
good morning !
morning , mr. sun .
i hope you had a good night &apos;s rest .
yes , thanks .
i slept like a log .
that &apos;s because you have a quiet room facing the back garden instead of one facing the noisy street like mine .
would you like some fruit juice ?
no , thank you .
i &apos;m not used to cold drinks in the morning .
how about cereals , then ?
cereals ?
. yes , please .
the cereal-boxes are on the side-board . just help yourself , will you ?
pass the milk jug to mr. sun , becky dear .
and here is the sugar basin . will you pass it along , too ?
what do you have for breakfast in china , sunny boy ?
in north china , we have steamed bread and porridge , together with salted vegetables .
sometimes we have fried cakes , washed down with bean-curd soup .
i see .
we can ask sarah to make porridge for you , if you like .
both becky and jack hate it , so .
please don &apos;t cook anything specially for me .
i &apos;ll just have things usually served here .
that &apos;s very considerate of you .
we often have eggs for breakfast .
sometimes it &apos;s bacon .
the prices for all kinds of meat shot up again recently !
god knows why !
not the prices again , please !
it &apos;s boiled eggs this morning .
how would you like your eggs done every morning , mr. sun ?
boiled , fried , poached , scrambled or would you prefer omelets ?
oh , it &apos;s not fair , mrs.west !
you &apos;ve never asked jack or me how we &apos;d like our eggs done .
we are often served with hard- boiled eggs when we prefer them half-done .
you &apos;ve been so heartless .
oh !
heartless , did you say ?
now , none of your cheek , my girl .
if you or jack had come all the way from the other side of the great wall , i might have asked you , too .
i wouldn &apos;t call the other side of the atlantic a place very near , would you , sunny boy ?
i simply love eggs .
so i like them no matter how they are done .
look out , mrs. west !
someone is worming his way into your heart .
how could he , if don &apos;t have one ?
didn &apos;t someone say i was heartless just now ?
good morning , sir .
a table for two ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ll show you to your table . this way , please .
please take a seat .
is the seat taken , please ?
sorry , david let me save him this seat , he &apos;ll come right now .
hello , kevin , all of the table are full , can i join you ?
ok , come here and sit at my table , please .
what food did you have , kevin ?
look !
fried fish , mashed potato and coffee .
they all seem delicious .
yes , they are all delicious .
we can drop in here for a quick lunch .
let &apos;s get that table over there .
this is a cafeteria .
we have to serve ourselves .
oh ?
just pick up a tray and move down that line .
can i take anything i want ?
sure .
where do we pay ?
there &apos;s a cashier at the end of the line .
we &apos;ll pay her .
i see .
which would you prefer , tea or coffee ?
coffee , please .
two coffees ?
yes .
certainly , sir .
will there be anything else ?
no , that &apos;s all , thanks .
thank you , sir .
this is the first time . i &apos;ve ever eaten in a cafeteria .
i &apos;m like a country girl in the big city , i don &apos;t know what to do .
i &apos;ll show you , just follow suit .
look at those people standing in the long line selecting the food from the counter .
yes-we should join the line too .
come on , ruth .
it &apos;s fun to try new foods and new ways .
you know , we usually stand in line to buy movie ticket , but we never heard of standing in line waiting for food !
that &apos;s what you call a cultural difference .
are those the food prices that are posted on the wall ?
yes , food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself .
how ?
just pick up a tray , then put a knife , fork , spoon and a paper napkin on it and start down the line .
how ?
tell me man behind the counter what you want .
fish , please .
you get two vegetable with it and some potatoes or rice , whichever you want .
okay . i like that vegetable but i don &apos;t know what to call it .
just point to it if you don &apos;t know the name . that one just happens to be asparagus .
all right . i &apos;ll have asparagus and some of that .
and what kind of salad do you like ?
a friend told me i should try a waldorf salad . that &apos;s this one with apples , raisins , nuts and mayonnaise , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , now pick up a dessert .
there is a jello , fruit , ice cream .
say no more . i want that fresh strawberry pie with whipped cream . that &apos;s my favorite .
what are you going to have ?
black walnut ice cream .
do you want coffee , tea or milk ?
let &apos;s see , i &apos;ll take milk .
ok .
just pick up a glass and put it on the machine and push it against the lever .
that &apos;s fun . how am i doing ?
great .
now e just pay the cashier at the end of the line and then find ourselves a table .
ok . this will be my treat .
oh , no , you don &apos;t .
all right , then , we &apos;ll go dutch .
next time . this time you &apos;re my guest .
my , it &apos;s nice to lunch with such a prosperous gentleman .
thank you .
gee , it &apos;s crowded .
look , one empty small table by that big picture window over there . let &apos;s go and get it .
ah , this is a pretty spot .
you can see the people passing by while you eat .
and they can see you eat while they pass and that &apos;s a pretty picture too .
you coin a neat phrase .
it &apos;s true !
is this the only type of place for lunch ?
there are some lunch counters , but they serve only a few specialities .
why can &apos;t you eat lunch in a restaurant ?
well you can , but the service isn &apos;t as fast .
most people only have a half an hour to one hour for lunch .
this time is too short for them to eat in a restaurant or to run back and forth from home to school or office , because the cities are too big .
so they eat quickly at the lunch counters ?
right .
lunch is normally a light meal anyway .
workers must either take lunch with them or get it near the place where they work .
what about the children ?
kids in school take sandwiches , fruit and cookies along with them or eat in school cafeterias .
this is delicious .
if all the food tastes as good as this i won &apos;t miss our own food too much .
i like american food !
i &apos;m glad you enjoy it .
are you done ?
i &apos;m full .
are you sure ?
you can get seconds .
i &apos;m positively full . i have no more room .
thank you very much .
don &apos;t mention it .
oh , there are so many people here !
yes , because the price is lower and the speed is quick , many people love to come here .
what shall we do first ?
keep the line with a tray , put a knife , a fork and a piece of paper napkin on it .
how do we order ?
look !
all the price of food and name are on the wall .
well.let &apos;s join the line along the counter together .
oh , it &apos;s so crowded here .
yes . people like to eat at a cafeteria . it &apos;s cheaper and quicker than other restaurants .
what shall we do now ?
just pick up a tray , put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it , and keep the line .
i see .
are those the food prices that are posted on the wall ?
yes , you can choose whichever you want .
what a variety !
meat , fried fish , meat rolls . they all sound delicious and make my mouth water .
yes . what are you going to have ?
i &apos;d like the fried fish .
ok . let &apos;s join in the line along the counter .
i &apos;d like to have one cheeseburger and fried potato , please .
eat here or take away ?
take away , please .
anything else ?
two crepes , please .
what put inside ?
one is raspberry jam , another one is almond jam and coke please .
here you are .
it &apos;s $ 5 altogether .
could i have some ketchup and napkins , please ?
yes , of course .
thank you .
what can i do for you ?
i want bacon cheese-burger and a little pizza .
anything else ?
please give me a potato salad , too .
okay .
what would you like to drink ?
i &apos;ll have a medium coke .
what can i do for you , ma &apos;am ?
i &apos;d like the barbecued sandwich and a large sprite .
do you take out ?
yes , there are so many people that i don &apos;t find a seat .
here you are .
how much ?
$ 2.25 .
i &apos;d like a hamburger , french fries , and coffee .
here or to go ?
i &apos;ll have it here .
just a minute , please .
i &apos;d like the hamburger with ketchup .
they all come with mustard and ketchup .
just ketchup , please .
we &apos;ll have to make a special one for you .
can you wait for five minutes or so ?
sure .
daddy , i &apos;m thirsty .
i &apos;m dying for a coke .

would like to play chinese chess with me ?
with pleasure .
but i haven &apos;t played it for a long time .
it &apos;s nothing .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;m only a beginner .
oh , look . there is a chessboard . those two men have already finished playing .
you &apos;re a very good player .
you &apos;re flattering me .
but once i won a prize .
so did i.
i won a prize last week but it was just a prize for beginners .
my prize was for the best player in the country .
really !
how i admire you !
could you play other kind of chess game ?
yes . when i was a little boy , i was fond of chinese draughts and army chess .
me too .
and later i learned how to play chinese chess .
at about eleven years old , i was taught to play chess .
but i got really to love this game only three years ago .
how about you ?
err . i can play weiqi .
great !
then let &apos;s have a game of weiqi ?
ok .
but after we finish playing chess .
now let &apos;s be serious .
all right . it &apos;s your turn .
how is this year &apos;s sino-japan chess challenge tournament going on ?
chinese ninth-dan player ma xiaochun takes on japan &apos;s ninth-dan player kataoka satosi for the 10th match today .
i am sure ma siaochun will win , for he is the newly crowned sino-japan masters champion .
i am not so optimistic .
ma xiaochun has never beaten kataoka satosi in their four previous encounters .
what is the result so far ?
in the previous nine games , japan won five while china took four .
china has to win the last two games to win the series .
where will the game be played ?
at the china &apos;s chess academy in beijing .
who will be ma &apos;s next opponent , if he wins today ?
if he wins , he will play awazi shuzo .
what will happen if he loses ?
ninth-dan chinese nie weiping will take over .
by the way , the cctv will show the game live on channel 8 between 4 : 00 to 6 : 00 pm .
chinese weightlifter yang bin won the first gold medal of the first east asian games .
wonderful !
which class is he in ?
he is in 54kg class .
what are his total results ?
he lifted a total of 262.5 kilograms .
his total results leveled the listed asian record of 262.5kg set by himself in fuzhou .
why did the korean who also lifted 262.5kg only got the silver medal ?
because he weighs more than yang bin .
is that the reason ?
that &apos;s quite interesting .
this rule is very reasonable and fair .
excuse me , bernard . what are the measures of a weightlifting platform ?
in general , it is 6 meters long and 4 meters wide .
what are basic requirements of the lifting ?
the weightlifter should lift the bar above head height with arms locked out and both feet in line .
of course there are numerous detailed requirements and rules .
i read from yesterday &apos;s newspaper that ms. ding meiyuan from china won the gold of the women &apos;s 75 kilograms plus class .
she is something .
just imagine raising 300 kilograms at a time .
actually the 300 kilograms is the total of the weights she raised both in the snatch and the clean and jerk .
i didn &apos;t know that .
what &apos;s their difference ?
in the snatch , the competitor raises the barbell in one uninterrupted motion from the platform floor to a position over the head .
but in the clean and jerk , the barbell is raised to the shoulder height , held there briefly , and then pushed overhead in a rapid motion of the arms .
i see .
in fact the clean and jerk consist of two steps .
for each style , the competitor is allowed three attempts . and the best of the three results is adopted to indicate his true ability .
how many referees are there in a weightlifting competition ?
three referees .
they will judge whether the lift is a &quot; good lift &quot; or a &quot; no lift . &quot;
how do they show their judgment ?
for a &quot; good lift , &quot; at least two of the three referees signal with a white light to show that they approve the lift .
a red light is the signal for a &quot; no lift . &quot;
if two or more referees disapproves the lift , then the result of the attempt is in valid .
i &apos;ve got it .
i like many sports , such us basketball , football , table tennis , badminton , tennis . but i don &apos;t know about weightlifting .
can you tell me something about it ?
sure .
weightlifting is the sport of lifting the heaviest weight possible .
heavy metal discs are attached to a barbell .
the object is to lift the bar above head height with the arms locked out and both feet in line .
barbell ?
it is called barbell ?
i even don &apos;t know how to call it .
it must be very heavy .
it is heavy , but the lifters can perform miracles .
how about chinese weightlifting ?
china is a dominant nation in world weightlifting .
that &apos;s great . i think each lifter must be every strong .
yes .
lifters began to practise when they were very young .
what is the optimum stating age for young weightlifters .
the optimum starting age is ten .
in my country weightlifting clubs hold training classes for children aged from ten to twelve , and from thirteen to fifteen .
maybe these young weightlifters will become world champions someday in the near future .
we &apos;re sure they can .
excuse me , i have forgotten the two kinds of weightlifting .
the two kinds are snatch and clean and jerk . it &apos;s easy to remember .
but what are the two techniques used in the snatch ?
the two techniques are the split and the squat .
and next you want to ask what the difference between them is , am i right ?
yes , i am sorry to cause you trouble .
never mind . let me tell you , but you should listen to the couch carefully next time .
well , in the split technique , as the lifter lifts the barbell , he thrusts his body underneath is . at the same time , the places one foot forwards and one foot backwards in a split position .
in the squat technique , as the lifter lifts the bar , he bends his knees and goes down into a low squatting position . at the same time , he raises the bar with his arms fully extended overhead .
and one more thing , both techniques can also be used in the clean and jerk . but the lifter must finish with his body erect , holding the barbell overhead .
his arms and legs must be straight , with his feet in line .
thank you for your help .
i &apos;ll concentrate my efforts next time .
that &apos;s fine .
lu li captured china &apos;s first gymnastics gold at the 25th olympic games .
did she win the women &apos;s vault ?
no . but she won uneven bars .
i remember that ma yanhong also won this event 8 years ago in los angeles olympics .
that &apos;s right .
before lu li &apos;s capture of gold , gymnastics was the only event where chinese women lagged behind chinese men .
where is lu li from ?
what &apos;s her age ?
she comes from hunan .
her performance was so perfect that the six judges all gave her 10 points . she &apos;s 15 years old .
well , it &apos;s rare in high-level competitions like the olympics .
china cup international gymnastics tournament opened yesterday in beijing capital gymnasium .
how many countries have participated in this tournament ?
a total of 54 gymnasts from 11 countries and regions took part in the annual tournament .
when was the tournament inaugurated ?
it began in 1988 .
are there any top gymnasts competing in this year &apos; s china cup ?
yes , there are pea gil-su of dprk , olympic pommel horse gold medalist , won this event again .
hans , i hear the sydney olympics had some new gymnastic events .
yes , there was one . it was trampoline .
have you heard of it before ?
yes .
i don &apos;t think it has a long history , does it ?
no .
in fact , trampoline didn &apos;t come into being until 1930s when american george nissen developed a prototype .
what are the basic skills in trampoline ?
trampoline skills include twists and somersaults in a variety of positions .
at the olympics , each is given a degree of difficulty , the higher the difficulty the higher the score .
how many skills does a routine contain ?
10 .
each skill in an optional routine should be different ; that is , skills should not be repeated in the same routine .
for all skills apart from straddle jumps , the legs should be kept together with the toes pointed .
and there is a rule
what is it ?
in the end the trampolines should be in an upright position for at least three seconds .
i guess points will be deducted if it is ended with an unstable position .
that &apos;s for sure .
have you read today &apos;s sports daily ?
no .
what &apos;s on ?
a golden girl of romanian gymnastics has been robbed of all her 1992 olympic medals .
is it true ? what medals ?
one gold , one silver and one bronze .
what did the thief steal her medals for ?
maybe only the thief knows .
besides 300 dm were also stolen .
how were all these things stolen ?
the thief broke into the house the gymnast shares with her parents .
what &apos;s the name of the gymnast ?
her name is milosevic . she is romania &apos;s best-known female gymnast .
lu li captured china &apos;s first gymnastics gold at the 25th olympic games .
did she win the women &apos;s vault ?
no. but she won uneven bars .
i remember that ma yanhong also won this event 8 years ago in los angeles olympics .

her performance was so perfect that the six judges all gave her 10 points . she &apos;s 15 years old .
well , it &apos;s rare in high-level competitions like the olympics .
there comes my favorite gymnast .
quite smart . how old is he ? can you guess ?
he is exactly twenty last monday .
i know something about him .
oh , what a somersault !
and this somersault in the air is some stunt .
oh , a giant circle !
a single arm circle !
that &apos;s some feat . it &apos;s a combination of strength and skill .
has he ever won the world champion ?
yes .
several times .
and last year , he won the world championship of iaac .
oh , hollow flyaway .
you see , his landing is both swift and sure .
i suppose gymnasts need iron will and unswerving spirit .
you are quite right .
don &apos;t you know he was received by the u.s. president bill clinton in the atlanta olympics ?
really ?
how i admire him !
look there . a girl is on the balance beam .
she looks so relaxed .
i dare say she is quite an experienced athlete .
she &apos;s balancing herself on the strength of a single arm .
it takes a lot of skill and physical strength to do that , doesn &apos;t it ?
yes , it surely does .
and how well she times every movement with the best of the music .
now she &apos;s off the beam .
and with such alacrity .
she must be the most excellent one on the balance beam .
i agree with you .
there comes my favourite gymnast .
how smart he is ! can you guess how old he is ?
he is exactly twenty last sunday .
i know about him quite well .
oh , what a somersault !
and this somersault in the air is some stunt .
oh , a giant circle ! a single arm circle !
that &apos;s some feat . it &apos;s a combination of strength and skill .
he must be a world champion .
yes .
several times .
and just last year he won the world championship of iaac .
i really take proud of him .
oh , hollow flyaway , wonderful !
and his landing is both swift and sure .
i suppose gymnasts require iron will and unswerving spirits .
you are quite right .
do you know he was received by the u.s. president bill clinton in the atlanta olympics ?
really ?
how i admire him !
look there . a girl is on the balance beam .
she looks so relaxed .
i dare say that she is quite an experienced athlete .
she &apos;s balancing herself on the strength with a single arm .
it need a lot of sill and physical strength to do that , doesn &apos;t it ?
yes , it surely does .
and how well she times every movement with the best of the music .
now she &apos;s off the balance beam .
and with such alacrity .
she must be the most excellent one on the balance beam .
i agree with you .
saul , do the fencers use the same kind of sword ?
no .
there are three kinds of sword used in the olympic fencing-foil , sabre , and epee .
how do they differ ?
the foil is the lightest of the three with a flexible rectangular blade .
the saber has a flexible blade with a cutting edge on one side .
and the epee is heavier than the foil , and its blade is stiffer .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;ve got the same rules , have they ?
no .
in foil and epee , a touch can be considered valid only if it is made with the point of the weapon .
the entire body is a valid target for the epee , but in foil a touch can be scored only on the body between the collar and hipbones .
in saber fencing , a hit may be made with the point &apos; the cutting edge , or the forward third of the back edge .
and the target areas include any part of the body above the waist , including the head .
how do the judges award the score ?
in fencing , it &apos;s really a tough job for the judges to correctly award the score .
so the electronic scoring system is adopted to record it .
when the valid part of the weapon touched the target area of the opponent &apos;s body , the system will record it automatically .
what are the main attacking skills in fencing ?
the lunge , the fleche &apos; and the thrust are the main attacking skills .
and the most important defensive skill is the parry , which is often followed by counter-riposte .
the olympic fencing tournament was delayed an hour .
what has happened ?
french official argued with the organizers over the draw .
what &apos;s the problem ?
two frenchwomen were placed in the same pool .
did they redraw ?
yes .
meygret was redrawn to fence germany &apos;s dobermeier .
did this please the french ?
no .
that did not please the french as the loser went directly out the tournament .
meygret saved the situation by winning .
is it possible for chinese fencers to get any gold medals at this olympics ?
i am afraid not .
why do you say so ?
because the most possible event is the women &apos;s foil fencing . and our fencer wang huifeng has been nipped by world champion trillini of italy .
wang hifeng only took the silver , didn &apos;t she ?
yes .
wang huifeng was defeated after a three-set thriller .
i hope chinese women &apos;s team will perform a miracle .
china is not a dominant nation in world fencing .
it &apos;s nothing .
china does well in many other olympic sports .
are you satisfied with chinese players &apos; achievements in the olympic games ?
yes .
i they are excellent .
how about you ?
well , i think they could be better .
what do you think of the standard of the top chinese fencers ?
i think that they are among the best in asia .
in your opinion , how can we improve the general standard of our fencers ?
firstly , china should have a development program for young fencers .
secondly , we should study the performance and techniques of the top fencers on film and videotape .
thirdly , we should invite a european coach .
and the fencers themselves should pay attention to the techniques while practicing .
yes .
improving the standard is the chinese fencers is not just the coaches &apos; business , nor is just the fencers &apos; . everyone of us should work hard .
it is worth an all-night celebration for the chinese shooting team .
you mean the two gold medals won by zhang shan and wang yifu .
exactly .
zhang shan outshot a field of male rivals to win the mixed skeet event and set a new olympic final record with 223 hits .
that &apos;s great .
this is the first time in olympic history that a woman won the mixed skeet title .
the other best result in this event by a woman was also achieved by a chinese , wu lanying who finished 11th at the last olympics in seoul . before her , no women had ever made the top 20 .
unfortunately , this is zhang shan &apos;s first and last chance to compete in the mixed event .
how come ?
at the next olympic games in atlanta in 1996 , women and men will compete separately .
what &apos;s zhang shan &apos;s age ?
she is 24 , and she will be 28 at next olympics .
twenty-eight is not an old age for a shooter .
how bout wang yifu ?
he has already been 31 years old .
what title did he capture ?
air pistol .
he also won a silver medal in free pistol two days ago .
what a sharp shooter !
hi , i heard that you &apos;ve been a shooter for over one year .
you are right .
being a shooter is quite interesting .
i &apos;m not familiar with shooting , it &apos;s an olympic game , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
it became in an olympic sport at the first modern olympic in athens in 1896 .
can you explain the prone position to me ?
i only know it is one of the shooting positions for the rile event .
of course . let me tell you , in the prone position , the shooter lies flat on his stomach , supporting the upper part of his body on his elbows . the butt of the rifle is against the shooter &apos;s shoulder or shoulder blade pit , and he has to hold the rifle with both of his hands .
it is difficult to do this , i think .
no , it is not very difficult .
i hope you &apos;ll teach me to shoot when you &apos;re free .
i &apos;d like to .
now there are many shooting halls in big cities , people has regarded shooting as a recreational activity .
what do you think of archery ?
i am not familiar with it . but i &apos;m a little interested in it .
and you ?
i &apos;m fond of archery very much .
do you know what is the gold center called ?
yes .
it &apos;s called the &quot; bull &quot;
is it difficult to aim at the target ?
for beginners , it must be hard .
can you teach me sometime next week ?
my pleasure
i like watching archery matches .
really ?
so do i.
it is said that tomorrow there will be an international archery competition in beijing shooting range .
shall we go and watch it together ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
we will meet at 8 : 00 at your home .
ok , i &apos;ll wait for you .
do you know whey there are two archery fields there ?
the one on the right is for official competition and the one on the left is for training .
is the competition site available before competition ?
the competition site will , according to fita rules , be open for official practice one day before starting of the competition .
what system will be adopted for the competition ?
the grand fita round will be adopted .
which country will be the possible champions for team events ?
korea .
despite the retirement of the world &apos;s best know female archer kim soo-nyung , the koreans are a class above the rest of the sport .
they had swept all four gold medals at the beijing games several years ago .
what do you think of archery ?
i am not familiar with it . but i &apos;m a little interested in it .
and you ?
i &apos;m fond of archery very much .
do you know what is the gold center called ?
yes .
it &apos;s called the &quot; bull &quot; .
is it difficult to aim at the target ?
for beginners , it must be hard .
can you teach me sometime next week ?
my pleasure .
when was modern pentathlon introduced to the olympic games ?
it became an olympic event in l912 .
it was designed by pierre de coubertin , the chief founder of the modern olympic games .
but unfortunately , the modern pentathlon &apos;s olympic history has all too often failed to live up to the lofty ideals of its founder .
what do you mean by that ?
in 1968 swedish competitor hans liljeavall was disqualified for consuming alcohol during the competition .
such things have also happened to other events rather than modern pentathlon alone .
but the incidence is especially high in case of modern pentathlon .
however , australian pentathletes haven &apos;t been found to have taken any banned drugs or other banned substances during the competition .
it &apos;s not the case .
at the seoul games of 1988 , alex watson failed a urine test which showed he had excessive levels of caffeine in his system .
really ?
watson was tested during the fencing competition and told the ioc medical commission hearing into the affair that he had drunk l2-15 cups of coffee and two or three cans of coca-cola at the venue over the 12 hours of competition .
what was the result ?
this did not satisfy the commission . and watson was disqualified and was given an hour to leave the olympic village .
but maybe watson had no intention to win by taking banned substance .
watson himself insisted that he was innocent .
therefore , athletes should be very careful with the food and medicine he takes during the competition .
but the case of boris onishenko had no controversy .
i don &apos;t suppose he is an australian .
no .
he is a pentathlete of former soviet union .
at the montreal games of 1976 he was disqualified , for he tampered with his epee , causing it to register hits even when none had been scored .
that &apos;s a real shame .
miguel has some very competitive rivals such as filip meirhaeghe from belgium and christoph sauser from switzerland .
what kind of bicycles do they ride ?
their bicycles are derailleurs , light and strong . they may have 5 to 15 speeds , and each can be applied to a different terrain .
in general , low gears for going uphill or against the wind . and high gears for pedaling downhill . and they can be slowed by gripping levers on the handlebars .
the handlebars are different from those of most bikes i saw in china last year which are an important means of transportation for the chinese .
the drop handlebars of the mountain bikes permit a low and comfortable riding position .
look , miguel begins to accelerate .
he has to break away from filip and christoph .
it seems that he wants to overtake from the left side .
miguel stops .
he has to or he1l crash into filip .
the competition is so fierce .
now , it is a competition between miguel and filip.christoph is left behind .
filip is leading .
common on , miguel .
pedal hard .
great !
miguel wins the gold medal .
good evening , susan .
hello , elizabeth .
i wonder if you1l watch the triathlon race tomorrow .
no . i &apos;ll be working tomorrow .
what &apos;s more , i &apos;ve no idea of what triathlon is .
it &apos;s a combination of swimming , cycling and running .
this event tries the racers , skills , strength , and willpower .
they will churn through a 1.5 kilometers swim , cycle through 40 kilometers and finish by pounding their way through a 10 kilometers run .
the hawaii ironman is even more grueling .
what swimming stroke are the competitors to adopt ?
any stroke is allowed .
can the competitors get a substitute if they get a flat tire ?
no .
but they are allowed to run with the bike to one of tire change stations placed around the course . trained teams then change the tire .
how will the competitor be penalized if he or she is found cutting the corner ?
he or she may be warned or issued a yellow card .
of course the offender will have to cover the corner he or she , has cut .
and two yellow cards result in disqualification .
that sounds fair .
if only i could be free tomorrow .
good-bye . susan .
bye .

the chinese table tennis players made a clean sweep of all gold medals in atlanta yesterday .
they &apos;re great !
table tennis is our national sport which gets most of the attention of the nation .
it &apos;s very popular .
this vast land has made many excellent players .
our table tennis stars are well-known just like you have basketball or baseball stars in america .
including you , the former world champion .
uhum .
now i come to american studying computer science .
i have stepped down from competition for 5 years .
but you &apos;re the best qualifier to coach this club .
i am .
stan , i really appreciate you for introducing me to come here .
don &apos;t mention it .
you know this is only my summer job .
the new semester &apos;s coming and i have to go back .
have you told the boss about this ?
not yet .
i &apos;m just thinking about this .
i think you might as well continue coaching here so that you can save some of your earnings to help meet your college expenses .
that can &apos;t be bad .
i &apos;m just curious about what kind of sports is the most popular in china .
first of all there &apos;s table tennis . that &apos;s almost our national game .
yes , one good thing about ping pong is that it doesn &apos;t need space . you can play it practically anywhere .

our table tennis stars are well-known just like you have basketball or baseball stars in america .
incredible !
china has won all the gold medals and most of other medals of table tennis .
it &apos;s nothing strange at all .
as for table tennis , china is the best in the world .
it &apos;s said only one chinese player can defeat another chinese in the final .
that &apos;s true in the final of men &apos;s single , waldner was defeated by kong linhui .
and all the gold and silver medals of women &apos;s single and double were won by the chinese players .
and they won both the gold medal and the silver medal of men &apos;s double , too .
which team won the bronze medal then ?
i mean men &apos;s double .
france .
but they lost to china 0-3 .
chinese are unmatchable in chop , drive , push shot , smash and nearly in all techniques .
they are of the attacking style rather than defending .
china is the hometown of table tennis .
i suppose that may be the reason why chinese are so excellent at it .
but the other day i read that table tennis originated from britain .
really ?
is it possible ?
yes .
that article did say so , i &apos;m sure .
frankly speaking , to watch chinese play table tennis is really thrilling .
at this olympic , i &apos;ve never missed a table tennis tournament involving china .
whenever there is such a match , don &apos;t forget to let me know .
ok .
china is back on top of the women &apos;s table tennis world .
it &apos;s not strange at all .
i remember chinese women &apos;s table tennis team has always been world champion .
if it is not so , that &apos;s quite stare .
china had won the women &apos;s title eight consecutive times before being topple in japan by united korea two years ago .
which team did china defeat this time ?
democratic people &apos;s republic of korea was their victim .
what was the result in the final ?
3 : 0 .
chinese women &apos;s team is so wonderful !
yes .
they are the best in the world .
how about chinese men &apos;s team .
they have entered the final by beating germany 3 : 1 .
which team will be china &apos;s opponent in the final ?
sweden .
they went through with a 3 : 1 semifinal victory over dprk .
they are tough opponent . they have world no . 1 player waldner .
china is no easy team . let &apos;s wait and see .
the chinese men &apos;s table tennis team downed the defending champion sweden in the final to win the team title last night at the 43 rd world table tennis championships .
it &apos;s so wonderful .
how was the final played ?
it is the closest final i &apos;ve ever seen .
the result was 3 : 2 .
it &apos;s a pity that i didn &apos;t watch it last night .
can you describe the game for me ?
ok .
in the first match , world no . 2 wang tao was defeated by olympic champion waldner .
ma wenge leveled the score 1 : 1 after beating person .
in the 3 rd match , chinese up-and-coming star ding song put china 2 : 1 up in only 15 minutes with his victory over karlsson .
in the decisive match , wang tao smashed persson with his fierce attacks and excellent backhand to realize china &apos;s dream of winning back the most coveted swaythling cup .
it sounds like a legend .
china has own the swaythiling cup many times , hasn &apos;t she ?
yes .
this is the 11th time .
who won the cup last time ?
the swedish did .
they beat chinese 3 : 1 two years ago .
and last night &apos;s victory was a sweet revenge for the chinese .
by the way , chinese women &apos;s team defeated south korea 3 : 0 , also winning their 11th team title the day before yesterday .
what has been the biggest upset so far as the 43 rd world table tennis championships going ?
i think the biggest upset so far is that saive of belgium , no. 1 in the world was chopped down by china &apos;s newcomer ding song .
really ?
in which round was saive pushed out of the game ?
he was upset in the third round of the men &apos;s singles .
i heard that ding song was a chopper , an excellent chopper .
you are not quite right .
he is a chopper .
but this chopping is quite different from other choppers .
his style is chopping and attacking .
chopping and attaching ?
how particular his style is !
maybe that &apos;s why he won the game easily . why did saive lose the match so easily ?
according to saive &apos;s coach wang dayong , it because he was not accustomed to ding song &apos;s style .
wang dayong though ding song &apos;s service was hidden and very hard to judge .
and ding song got many aces in the match .
how wonderful ! ding song is !
at the end of the first serving denton is beating ronald 4 to 1 .
yes , but he won &apos;t keep his lead .
he is losing his agility . his returns are becoming slower .
well , it &apos;s ronald &apos;s turn to be server .
ronald always puts a lot of english on his serve .
did you see that ?
he did a backspin serve , denton didn &apos;t know how to do it .
and ronald prefers the shake-hands grip , so he can smash the ball with a backhand stroke more easily .
good job !
the smash has earned him another point .
wow !
what a good play !
denton just hit an excellent forehand return .
he returned it so quickly that ronald accidentally hit it on the volley .
that &apos;s a fault , and a point to denton .
well , now , it &apos;s 4 to 5 , and it &apos;s ronald &apos;s serve , the last in this serving .
oh !
ronald confused denton again with his serve .
he used so much back-spin , the ball almost died when it hit denton &apos;s half of the table .
ronald seems to know all kinds of serve techniques-the backhand topspin and backspin serves , the forehand topspin and backspin serves , and the high toss serves .
denton finds it difficult to counter ronald &apos;s attack , and he hits it out .
it &apos;s five-all tie . denton is to serve .
well served !
this time he bounced the ball and it just missed the net .
ronald could only play a straight return .
they each have their own advantages . there &apos;s no way to predict who &apos;s going to win .
let &apos;s wait and see .
hello , sir .
can i help you ?
yes . er , have you read about the olympic games of table tennis in today &apos;s newspaper , miss ?
yes , i have .
can you play table tennis ?
well , yes , but only a little .
wonderful game , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
i &apos;m interested in table tennis so much that i never miss any table-tennis match .
oh ?
you are crazy about table tennis .
yes .
you see , there is men &apos;s team event , women &apos;s team event , men &apos;s singles , women &apos;s singles , and men &apos;s doubles , women &apos;s doubles , mixed doubles ; we have attacking player , defensive player ; they get a shake hand grip , penhold grip ; and cut , chop , push shot , smash ; take a long drive off the table , fast attacks over the table , combine long drives with drop shots , exchange drives stroke forehead and backhand . oh , very much excellent !
that &apos;s really so , sir .
do you know what &quot; best of three or best of five games &quot; mean ?
yes . i know , sir .
the most exciting one is a seesaw match .
you are right , sir .
and in the crucial game , you should be serious about each stroke .
certainly .
now what can i show you , sir ?
oh , sorry . i almost forget my business .
do you want some tennis shoes ?
er . no , i have had a tennis shoes .
then running shoes ?
no . i &apos;d like to buy some carpet slippers - like those .
carpet slippers ?
yes .
i want to be comfortable when i &apos;m watching television .
john and rose love table tennis .
today they have gone to watch a singles game t the university .
they have been watching the game for a long time . now we can learn from their conversation .
hall is beating evans 5 - love at the end of the first serving .
yes , but he won &apos;t keep his lead .
he is losing his agility . his returns are becoming slower .
well , evans is the server now , let &apos;s see how hall returns his serves .
evans always puts a lot of english on his serve .
if hall isn &apos;t agile enough , this is when we &apos;ll see it most clearly .
did you see that ?
he served the ball with so much right english , hall didn &apos;t know how to do it .
yes . that &apos;s this best trick . that &apos;s why he used the penhold grip on his paddle .
he said he could put a lot more english on the ball . i don &apos;t know whether it is true or not .
yeh !
and hall prefers the shake-hands grips , because he can smash the ball with a backhand stroke more easily .
so , now we &apos;re going to see which technique is better .
personally i can &apos;t tell the difference between them .
my playing is so bad that it doesn &apos;t matter which grip i use .
wow !
that was a good play . evans just hit an excellent forehand return .
he returned it so quickly that hall accidentally hit it on the volley .
that &apos;s a fault , and a point to evans .
so , now it &apos;s 5 - 4 to hall , and it &apos;s evans &apos; serve , the last in this serving . now hall is starting to look worried . he &apos;s losing his lead .
wow !
evans confused him again with his serve . used so much back-spin , the ball almost died when it hit hall &apos;s half of the table .
yeh . he found it difficult to return the ball after that . he hit it out . the umpire didn &apos;t have to think twice about that .
so it &apos;s a five-all tie at the end of the second serving . the last time i saw evans make a come-back like this was in a doubles game about one year ago .
evans , and his partner , took their opponents to deuce , and they stayed there for a long time before getting the two advantage points they needed to win the game .
well . he might do it again .
i hope so . it &apos;s hall &apos;s turn to serve . let &apos;s see .
oh ! nice serve .
did you see that . he hooked the ball putting so much english on it that you could easily see it curve through the air and just clipped the edge of the table .
that &apos;s the first clip-shot of the game . and we re looking at one very lucky man . it was nearly out .
and the shortest rally possible .
let &apos;s see if hall &apos;s luck stays good .
. it didn &apos;t last long . this time he played a net-ball .
that &apos;s a fault , and a point to evans . they &apos;re tying again .
yes , he tried to serve too close to the net . a little too close . it couldn &apos;t possibly have been a let .
it was far too low .
. well served . this time he bounced the ball and it just missed the net .
evans could only play a straight return .
it doesn &apos;t matter , they &apos;re both rallying well now .
look at that speed . hall &apos;s certainly found his agility again . this has got to be the longest rally of the game .
they can &apos;t keep this going for long .
lovely weather , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
are you chinese ?
yes , i am .
do you come to the states for traveling ?
no , i am not a tourist .
i &apos;m an athlete .
i join the olympics .
oh , really !
what &apos;s your event ?
table tennis .
great !
my name is grace henderson .
nice to meet you !
my name is liu wei .
nice to meet you !
let me introduce my husband .
bill , come here .
right there .
bill , this is . , sorry , what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s just in the tip of my tongue .
liu wei .
oh , liu wei .
bill , he &apos;s a chinese table tennis player .
how wonderful !
liu wei , this is my husband .
call me bill .
nice to meet you , bill .
nice to meet you .
we come from seattle .
guess why we come to atlanta ?
i suppose you just come to watch the competitions .
you only say half of it .
we go out of our way to be here just for cheering for the chinese table tennis team .
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;re crazy about table tennis , though we &apos;re only average players .
the chinese team is great !
i &apos;m so happy to hear that .
bill and i were married just because we both like playing table tennis .
jim , how often do you come bowling ?
not as often as i &apos;d like to . it &apos;s so expensive here in beijing , and you often have to wait on line for a lane on weekend . so may be only once a month .
how about yourself ?
about the same .
i don &apos;t take it too seriously .
my highest score is only 135 points , which i got only once .
i usually average around 110 .
it &apos;s not the score that &apos;s important for me it &apos;s the fun .
me too my highest score is only 130 and like you . i average around 110 .
so it sounds like it &apos;s going to be an evenly matched game .
good . it &apos;s more fun that way .
what ball do you roll with ?
i usually bowl with an eight ball . i like the control of a light ball . i can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . then i can put it just where i want it when i bowl .
well .
i like them a little heavier .
i don &apos;t have as much control , usually bowling straight . but the extra momentum compensates for that .
it &apos;s harder to bowl hook shots , but i don &apos;t mind .
last night , jeff &apos;s curves were of high level .
he even won three games in succession . the average scores were around200 .
you were good too !
three strikes at your first attempt .
although annie &apos;s strikes were few , her spare ability was good .
yes .
annie &apos;s postures was graceful . people who do not know her may think she is a trained bowing player .
after all , maiga is professional origin . even his opening moves are 200 scores .
i will learn some skills from him indeed .
maiga , you just said that jeff &apos;s way of play was curve . could you introduce it to me ?
jeff , you say it just as well .
however , i can do some makeup to you .
all right .
the curve ball is also called arc line ball .
generally speaking , the curve can be divided as : hook , small curve and big curve .
its characteristic is that after the ball leaves the hand , it turns off in the course of its move and moves out at a smart arc line .
a ball generally weighs 16 pounds . the angle of striking for a right-handed athlete is generally at the 1-3 locations .
the european and american athletes mostly use the curve ball in international competitions .
although curves of big arc lines are higher in rate of hit its level of difficulty in techniques is higher and it is not easy to command in a short time .
a champion of the american professional bowling association used to create a record of average 254 scores in 56 games in succession . among them there were two 300 scores .
he mostly used the method of the big curve , whose angle of striking can reach six degrees .
is there any other easier method ?
yes , there is .
the asians mostly use the method of flying saucer . the flying saucer ball is also called peg-top ball .
taiwanese invented it according to the body characteristics of the asians .
its characteristic is that the path of the ball is a straight line . after the ball leaves the hand , it spins vertically to the path of ball . a ball generally weighs at 10-12 pounds . the standard angle of striking is 1-3 or 1-2 locations .
in actual combat , it is able to have a tough fight with the curve .
hello , guangya .
good morning , daming .
sit down , please ..
please have a cup of tea .
thank you .
i came to ask you something about handball . can you help me ?
certainly .
handball is very popular in europe and it is a very wonderful game at the olympics .
what does a handball court look like ?
it &apos;s a rectangle , 40 meters long and 20 meters wide , including two goal areas .
how many players does a team consist of ?
seven , including a goalkeeper .
how does a game start ?
before the game , the referee tosses a coin . the team captain who wins the toss has the right to throw-off . and the other term captain has the right to choose ends .
how long does a game last ?
two halves of thirty minutes , and there is a ten-minute interval .
what skills are required of the players ?
they should be skilled at running , jumping , passing , catching , dribbling , shooting , and blocking .
can the player take some steps with the ball ?
yes , but no more than 3 steps .
many handball rules involve the number &quot; three . &quot;
for example , as soon as the ball is held in one or both hands , it must be played within 3 seconds or after no more than 3 steps .
what can the referee do if the player has done something against the rule ?
he can hold up a yellow card to warn the player or give him a suspension of 2 minutes or even disqualify the guilty player .
i &apos;ve got a rough idea of the game now .
thank you , guangya .
what is called volleyball ?
volleyball is a six-a-side court game which is similar to badminton and tennis . however , volleyball is played by hand directly .
what is the object when you are playing volleyball ?
to return the ball across the net .
does volleyball require something ?
yes , of course .
every sport has its requirement , volleyball is without exception .
it requires speed , strength , balance , stamina , agility , felicity , coordination and good footwork .
is volleyball included in the olympics ?
yes , it is . it became an olympic sport in 1964 .
what officials are there in a volleyball game ?
officials include a referee , an umpire , a scorer , and four linesmen .
i have two questions for you .
what are they ?
something about serving .
first one is how much time does the server have after the referee blows his / her whistle . and the second one .
slow down , i &apos;ll take care of them one by one .
first , after the ref blows his / her whistle , the server then has 8 seconds to contact the ball . and it won &apos;t be called a fault as long as he &apos;s jumped up within the 8 seconds .
ok .
the second one is : can a server jump forward of the end line while serving ?
no problem , as long as at the time of last contact with the court , your body was within the legal service area .

the stadium is bursting with loud cheers .
it &apos;s a pity that we &apos;re not there .
it &apos;s ok with tv .
hope our national team would regain its glories .
i hope so .
and i believe so .
but i do think you men &apos;s volleyball team should learn something from these girls such as the spirit of fighting or anything like that .
in a volleyball match , the most important factors are our fighting spirits , solidarity and unity .
we have them .
but .
what a good quick spike from a flat short set !
sun jiong sets the ball from position 3 to li fen .
li fen jumps and spikes .
the ball scores a placement .
two all .
sun jiong &apos;s a good setter .
it &apos;s the chinese team &apos;s service .
no. 12 , zhou jing , is going to serve .
she serves from the baseline of position 6 .
the overhand floater serves to position 5 .
the player at position 5 digs the ball out of bounds .
serve again !
the cannon-ball service .
5 all , 7 all , 8 all , 10 all , 11 all .
the championship match is really breathtaking .
yeah .
the score rises alternatively .
a chinese player reaches over net .
luis is a killer . she not only spikes hard but also has tremendous spring .
she is always trouble to our defence .
our team should closely defend her and correctly judge the opponent &apos;s intentions .
the score has been so close , and many of our team are rookies .
they &apos;re under great pressure for sure .
relax .
14 all . 15 all .
li fen dinks the ball quickly .
score !
16 : 15 .
li fen is different from luis .
she &apos;s not as physically strong .
but she can use and rely on other strengths .
right .
luis smashes crosscourt at position 4 .
two chinese players erect a double block .
luis hits off blocker &apos;s hands .
16 all .
hold on !
the cuban side makes the service . the hook float service .
when did beach volleyball become an official event of the olympics ?
that was in atlanta 1996 .
it was an attractive event . i &apos;m fond of it .
you &apos;ll be interested in it when you have watched one match .
how many players for each team ?
only two . for the traditional volleyball , there are six .
a beach volleyball match consists of three sets . the team who wins two sets is considered the winner .
how about the scoring rules ?
only the team who serves the ball can obtain one point .
that &apos;s very like the traditional volleyball in the 1980s .
yes .
and substitution is not allowed for the beach volleyball . but for each five points , the two teams will change ends , for instance , when they are 3-2 or 5-0 .
that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;ll watch it this evening .
volley ball was dominated by latin americans in 1992 .
you mean brazil and cuba &apos;s gold medals at the barcelona returned home from barcelona , just as their soccer team was treated after they won the world cup in 1970 .
yes .
brazil were given a hero &apos;s welcome when they returned home from barcelona , just as their soccer team was treated after they won the world cup in 1970 .
brazil is the only team to compete in all eight olympics since volleyball became and olympic event at the tokyo games in 1964 .
this time they ousted twice olympic champion the u.s. in the semifinal , and went on to beat darkhorse the netherlands in the final , thus to become the first south american team to win a major world tournament .
the cuban women &apos;s team could have become the olympic champion earlier .
i see .
you &apos;re referring to their boycott of the previous two olympics .
the chinese women &apos;s team , which won two world cups , two world championships and on olympic tournament in the 80s , suffered a crushing defeat to drop to the 7th place , the lowest ranking since 1981 .
the men &apos;s squad of the unified team , which made its last appearance in barcelona , also ended with a modest 7th place .
reigning world men &apos;s champion italy just ranked fifth .
i think in the coming years , brazil , italy , u.s. and the netherlands will fight closely with each other for the men &apos;s supremacy .
luke and neil are co-workers .
last night they played a match of volleyball .
now they are at work , and are discussing last night &apos;s match .
they were on the same team , and they won the match .
what a good match we played yesterday !
i think it was our tightest playing so far .
we were so well co-ordinated , the other team didn &apos;t have a chance .
they played too loosely . i never saw them set up perfectly . they always seemed to be saving the ball , rather than spiking it .
i think that was their back-line players &apos; problem . they only had a player who could hit a good forearm-pass .
quiet !
the manger is coming towards this direction ?
that was close .
now what was i saying ?
oh , yes ! i think that she is their best player .
she really served well , and she used the tennis-serve , too . all the others used the underarm-serve when they serve , though they are stronger than her .
i admire her for that .
what about my serve ?
i use the same technique .
but you &apos;re a man . you &apos;re stronger . that &apos;s why you &apos;re better at spiking , and slamming than me . it &apos;s why i kept trying to set you up all the time . but you kept missing them .
that wasn &apos;t my fault . you always hit the ball to low .
i had to .
if it had gone too high , they would have blocked it too easily , and blocking was something that they were very good at . maybe the only thing .
not true .
they were good at playing net-balls . they even played a couple of net-balls from their serve .
they weren &apos;t the only ones who made mistakes . i remember the umpire gave away the right to serve of net-fault you made .
i also remember the same thing happening for you , but for holding the ball . holding is worse than a net-fault . don &apos;t you agree ?
that was unfair . i was just trying to slam , and she gave me a fault for holding .
that slam-shot was the same as all the others i &apos;d played . i don &apos;t know why she faulted me for that one .
but it was an easy mistake to make unlike when you went overtime . that was bad playing . what happened there ?
i think the volley had been going on for too long . we &apos;d started volleying too quickly . i think it was close to 30 turns . all i could think about was returning the ball .
then when someone lobbed the ball , it was just too how , and i dived to save it .
it really made no difference . if i hadn &apos;t faulted for an overtime , the ball would have touched the court and ended the volley anyway .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter . we won , and we played a lot better than our last match .
we were always in the lead , even from the start of the first game .
in the match before this one , we were often tied . so we must be improving , or our opponents are getting worse .
i think they &apos;re getting worse . that match we started with a one-all tie .
we were also tying at fourteen-all until i spiked the next two advantage points that we needed .
we could easily have lost that match . but this one we son easily .
next time i think .
. well , i think that we should talk about this later , and do what we came here to do , work .
ok .
let &apos;s get down to business .
luis is a killer . she not only spikes hard but also has tremendous spring .
she is always trouble to our defence .
our team should closely defend her and correctly judge the opponent &apos;s intentions .
the score has been so close , and many of our team are rookies .
they &apos;re under great pressure for sure .
relax .
14 all . 15 all .
li fen is different from luis .
she &apos;s not as physically strong .
but she can use and rely on other strengths .
right .
luis smashes crosscourt at position 4 .
two chinese players erect a double block .
luis hits off a blocker &apos;s hands .
16 all .
hold on !
the cuban side makes the service . the hook-float service .
the referee judges it &apos;s bad . 17 : 16 . service over !
the game point now .
hello , bingzi speaking .
hello , bingzi .
this is haifang .
i called to tell you that there will be the hockey final this evening .
but i don &apos;t know anything about hockey .
it &apos;s easy to understand its rules .
like football , the players have in mind the aim to score by getting the ball into the opponents &apos; goal .
how many players are there in each team ?
eleven , same as that in football .
they compete to use their hooked sticks to push , pass and dribble a small , hard and generally white ball in order to score .
hooked stick ?
yes .
a hockey stick has two sides . the left side is flat , and the right side is rounded .
it is only with the flat of the stick that you are permitted to play the ball .
some players have excellent stick work .
in football , we have foot work . and in hockey you mentioned stick work .
an essential skill necessary for playing hockey is the ability to control , pass , push , stop and shoot the ball with your hockey stick .
can you use your feet to control the ball ?
no .
the players are not allowed to use feet or any part of the body except the goalkeeper .
how can the players score ?
scoring can be done from the field goal , the penalty corner , and the penalty stroke .
what are field goal , penalty corner and penalty stoke mean ?
a field goal is a goal scored from open , continuous play .
it can only be taken from the shooting circle , a roughly semi-circular area in front of the opponents &apos; goal .
if a defending team breaks certain rules , the other team may be awarded a penalty corner .
to take a penalty corner , one attacker stands with the ball on a designated spot on the back line . the player pushes out the ball to other attackers , waiting to take a shot at goal .
and a penalty stroke is a shot taken on goal by a chosen player and defended only by the goalkeeper . the shot is taken from a spot 6.4 meters directly in front of the goal .
it sounds interesting .
how long does a hockey match last ?
a hockey match of regulation length lasts 70 minutes . it is broken into two halves of 35 minutes each .
the team with the most goals at the end of the 70 minutes is the winner .
it is also possible for a match to end in a draw .
but in the matches at olympics , you must have a winner .
in those cases , a match which is tied at the end of regulation time , then goes into extra time .
the first team to score in extra time wins , and if necessary , they may have a penalty stroke competition .
thank you , haifang .
your explanation has made me reach the decision to watch the final .
let &apos;s hurry . the game has already started .
miss ruth , walking fast
our seats are in the grandstand .
it &apos;s that gate over there .
we have to go up these steps .
i hope we don &apos;t have to sit in the sun .
there is no sun in the grandstand . it &apos;s completely covered .
it &apos;s only in the bleachers where you have to sit in the sun .
where do you usually sit ?
i like to sit in the bleachers . you can see the game better .
it &apos;s cheaper and most of the real baseball fans sit in the bleachers .
then why are we sitting in the grandstand ?
it &apos;s shady in the grandstand and more comfortable for you .
ladies usually sit in the grandstand .
let &apos;s go down this aisle and sit behind home plate . then we can see the pitcher better and watch how he throws his curves .
what is home plate ?
let &apos;s get a seat first .
i &apos;ll explain everything to you later .
they are sitting in the grandstand
heavens ! they &apos;re already starting to play the second inning .
but the score is still nothing to nothing .
then we really haven &apos;t missed anything .
you don &apos;t understand .
sometimes a game can go right up to the last inning and the store will be nothing to nothing .
that simply means that neither team has scored a run .
there are nine innings in a game , aren &apos;t there ?
that &apos;s right - except that sometimes if the score is tied at the end of the ninth , they have to play extra innings until the is broken .
that &apos;s the pitcher out there in the center , isn &apos;t it ?
the fellow who is getting ready to throw the ball .
that &apos;s right .
he &apos;s winding up .
and the player who will try to hit the ball is the batter . the player behind him is the catcher - isn &apos;t that right ?
you see i know much more about baseball than you imagined .
there goes the pitch now .
the batter swung and missed .
each better has three tries . that was his second try or &quot; strike &quot; .
if he misses again he will be out .
those other players out the field - who are they exactly ?
they all belong to the opposing team .
the man to the right of the pitcher standing near first base is called the first baseman .
the man over to the left is the third second baseman .
the three men far out in the field are all fielders .
the pitcher is throwing the ball again .
oh , the batter hit the ball - but not very well .
is that a strike ?
the batter hit a foul ball .
any ball that is hit but doesn &apos;t land within the limits of the playing field is a foul ball .
ordinarily it counts as a strike - except if the batter has two strikes on him . then it doesn &apos;t count , and the batter has another chance to hit the ball .
when does the team in the field get a chance to bat the ball ?
as soon as three men are put out on the team which is at bat , the side is said to the retired .
they then take the field and the other team comes in to have its turn at bat .
when the second team has been retired the &quot; inning &quot; is over .
the game continues in this way for nine innings with the two teams alternating in the field and at bat .
whoever scores the most runs during the nine innings wins the game .
the batter has hit the high in the air .
he has just hit a &quot; fly &quot; .
when he hits the ball along the ground , it is called a &quot; grounder &quot; .
that is the shortstop who is going back now to catch the fly .
he has caught it and the batter is out .
who is the man standing behind the catcher dressed in blue and wearing a pad over his chest ?
that &apos;s the umpire .
he decides whether the pitcher has thrown a ball or strike .
he also decides when runners are safe or out at the bases .
he must be an important person .
how does one get to be an umpire ?
according to some of the fans , umpires are just old baseball players who have become nearsighted .
all right , mike . we did what i wanted to do yesterday .
today is your day .
my day ? i &apos;m afraid to ask , but what do you mean ?
i know there must be something special that you want to do while we &apos;re in town , such as going to shea stadium and .
yeah .
i &apos;d love to see a new york mets game before we leave !
see ?
why don &apos;t you call the stadium and find out how to get tickets ?
mike calls the stadium
hello .
can you tell me how i can get tickets for today &apos;s game ?
we &apos;re staying in manhattan now .
there are ticket offices in manhattan , but you can just come down to the stadium before the game and buy your tickets here .
where &apos;s the stadium ?
how can i get there ?
are you driving ?
no .
than take the no. 7 train to she stadium .
it &apos;s about ten minutes &apos; walk form the train station to the stadium .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
at the stadium
who are the mets playing against tonight ?
the los angeles dodgers .

i don &apos;t know .
this guy &apos;s already hit two home runs ; maybe we should walk him .
no way , i can get him out .
just give me another chance .
john , this guy &apos;s dangerous .
he can hit that ball a ton .
we can &apos;t chance it .
look , coach , i &apos;ll throw him curve balls .
we can &apos;t just walk him .
all right .
it &apos;s in you hands .
just be careful .

great !
will you please explain to me something about game while we are watching it ?
it will be my pleasure .
shall we go together then ?
certainly .
see you later .
see you later .
hector , i &apos;ve decided to learn to play baseball from this weekend .
can you help me with some of basic knowledge ?
with pleasure .
can you give me a brief introduction to the lay-out of a baseball field ?
the field is divided into an infield and an outfield .
the infield square has the four bases at its corners and it is also called the diamond . the diamond is surrounded on two sides by the outfield which is fair territory , and on the other two sides by foul territory .
to get a better idea of it , i &apos;ll show you to the field this afternoon .
it &apos;s so kind of you .
where do the pitcher and the hitter stand ?
on the pitcher &apos;s mound and at the home plate , respectively .
how is a run score ?
a run is scored when a player makes his way round all of the bases and back to home without being put out .
how many outs are there in an inning ?
each team has three .
can you explain a strike to me ?
when the pitcher throws to the batter , it is a strike if he swings and misses , if he hits the pitch into foul territory , or if he doesn &apos;t swing at a pitch in the strike zone .
when is the batter allowed to walk ?
after four balls .
how does the batter score a home run ?
if the batter is able to circle the bases on one hit , it is a home run .
most home runs are hit over the outfield fences around fair territory .
what are the basic individual skills of a baseball player ?
it &apos;s essential for him to acquire the skills in hitting , pitching , fielding , accurate throwing , base running , and stealing bases .
how does the pitcher vary the delivery of his throws ?
he uses various grips , such as the curve ball , the knuckle ball , the slider , and the fast ball .
what are the most important elements of successful batting ?
the batting stance , the backswing and stride , the swing and contact with the ball , and the follow-they are all very important .
ann , i didn &apos;t expect you can raise so many questions .
the best way to find the answers is to play it personally .
that &apos;s the reason why i &apos;ve decided to learn it from this very weekend .
let &apos;s go out for some exercises .
that &apos;s a good idea .
let &apos;s play some basketball ?
sorry . i &apos;d rather not .
i don &apos;t care much for basketball .
how about playing badminton ?
yes it &apos;s a favorite of mine .
look !
mrs bell , the players are marching into the arena .
which team is which ?
the women in red are from beijing .
the players in blue are the shanghai team .
i &apos;m afraid i know next to nothing about basketball .
have you ever been a game before ?
well , my husband likes to watch sports on tv so i have seen a few games , but this is my first live game .
i &apos;m especially excited because these are women players .
are there any women &apos;s teams in america ?
there are no professional women &apos;s teams although there are some amateur women players .
but women &apos;s sports don &apos;t get much publicity in america .
women are very active in sports in china .
oh , yes , it &apos;s very different here .
professional sports in america are a big business .
oh , the game is about to start .
oh , good .
you must be sure to explain everything to me . basketball is such a fast-moving game . without your help i &apos;ll be lost for sure .
i &apos;ll do my best .
jees !
what a game . i love playing man-to-man defence , when i can keep my man from scoring .
yeah !
if we had been playing zone defence , i don &apos;t think we &apos;d have beaten them by so much . we might only have tied , and then gone into overtime .
oh !
i don &apos;t know . after you hit that long jump-short in the first quarter , i knew we were going to win .
yeah !
their play was too loose . they should have played a tighter game . their defence seemed confused , uncoordinated , and their centre didn &apos;t seem to know what their forwards were doing . those guys were all over the court .
i noticed that too . their guards didn &apos;t seem to be guarding anyone .
hey !
but when those guys were on the offensive , they were mean . they kept cutting through our defence like we were sleeping .
but they did nothing once they had gotten through our defence . i lost count of the number of air-balls those guys put up .
do you remember their number 10 putting up a shot from the free-throw line , in the second quarter ?
do i remember !
i was the guy blocking him . he threw a brick because he was trying to avoid me .
i haven &apos;t seen a brick that big since i was in junior high school . that was bad playing .
what happened with that free-throw you got after their guard came up from behind , and hit you ?
so i missed . we all make mistakes .
i &apos;m going to have to practice my free-throw shots a little more .
practice !
it was a rebound . you were on the free-throw line , and the ball didn &apos;t even touch the hoop .
it bounced off the backboard straight , onto their possession . if you &apos;d just put it up a little softer , it might have dropped into the key , so that one of our guys could have tipped it in . at least we would have scored .
hey !
we all put up bad shots , and good ones too .
i also got a slam dunk in that game . that isn &apos;t what i call bad playing .
true .
that is something i have never managed to do during a game . the feeling must be amazing .
so that &apos;s what you were doing .
i noticed you trying to sit in the key and wait for a pass . were you trying to slamdunk ?
no , i was just trying to be in the right place at the right time . waiting for a pass , and watching the clock so that i wouldn &apos;t foul .
did you see the basketball game last night ?
yes , can you believe it went into three overtimes ?
i know i was on the edge of my seat .
i wish i could go to the next game , but it is out of town .
there is nothing like being in the action .
me , too .
you have to admit the best part of the game was the slam dunk from the free throw line .
you &apos;re right .
that was quite a move .
what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
i like basketball .
do you know how to play ?
yes .
would you like to play a game of one-to-one with me ?
sure , i &apos;ll go and get my ball .
what do you think of your playing in china ?
i feel good .
i love this land .
people are friendly .
fans are quite interesting and enthusiastic .
and how do you think about chinese basketball players ?
well , some young players just don &apos;t take the game as serious as they should .
the talent is there , the dedication isn &apos;t .
the same story in the states .
did you win any award in the states ?
no .
i haven &apos;t even thought in terms of me winning an award .
my main concern is with the w &apos;s and l &apos;s .
i think we all get credit when we all play well .
in nba there is the nba &apos;s most valuable sixth men .
guys who win it are always big-time scorers .
voters usually look at points instead of what a guy really contributes to a team .
it would be nice to win .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll get it .
but i do think i deserve to be in the running for it .
so what do you do in a game ?
i just keep myself efficient at stopping opposing players from scoring , setting up my teammates for baskets , pulling down important rebounds , and setting the tone for my team .
it &apos;s the team-first mentality .
so your forte , so to speak , is defense , not scoring points .
and you like to play the on-court leadership .
that &apos;s it .
what sort of player do you want yourself to be ?
or what &apos;s your ideal sort of player ?
i just want myself to shoot , rebound , block shots , pass the ball , everything .
i have the ability to change any game because i can play three different positions-point guard , shooting guard and forward .
what about you ?
well , i want to be a coach .
coach a team and prove it to be a major factor in the national league matches .
how do you work ?
wherever i &apos;ve played , i &apos;ve always sat next to the coaches during the games , listening to what they talk and taking notes .
all these help keep me focused ;
i &apos;ve learned a lot over the years and developed my leadership qualities .
i &apos;ve been able to provide guidance to the younger players .
yeah .
i can see that .
you &apos;ve set a good example to your teammates .
thank you .
what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
i like basketball .
do you know how to play ?
yes .
would you like to play a game of one-on-one with me ?
sure , i &apos;ll go and get my ball .
do you feel like playing with one ?
sure .
i &apos;m not very good , though .
that &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re just playing for fun .
do you want the ball first ?
let &apos;s shoot for it .
whoever gets the first basket gets the ball .
okay , who should shoot first ?
i &apos;m going to have to call foul on that play .
what do you mean ?
i didn &apos;t foul you .
you hit my elbow when i was shooting .
that &apos;s a foul .
you hit your elbow on my head .
if anyone fouled , it was you .
ok . just forget it .
you never play fair anyway .
no .
go ahead and take your free throw .
hello , huajian .
did you watch the live broadcast of the women &apos;s basketball match yesterday ?
no . but i &apos;ve already got the result .
expected that the chinese team would be defeated
nor had i.
that means they have no chance to compete for the medals . but the failure doesn &apos;t mean the chinese women basketball team is inferior to the other teams in their abilities , techniques and skills .
still , i think the they are great .
i &apos;m proud of them .
we have to admit that chance played an important role .
what &apos;s chinese women team &apos;s best result in the olympics ?
they won the silver medal at the barcelona olympic games .
they routed cuba by nearly 40 points and reached the final .
with which team did they compete for the gold medal ?
the unified team .
the us women &apos;s basketball team seems to be winning the gold medal .
it &apos;s very hard to predict the result .
as a matter of fact , the australian team can rival the american team in many respects , especially in personal skills and team work .
as for the men &apos;s basketball , the american is sure to win the gold medal , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
undoubtedly , the so-called &quot; dream team &quot; has no rival , since nba professionals are permitted to participate .
however , the other teams are growing stronger .
take lithuania for example . it won &apos;t be a piece of cake for america to beat lithuania , although america will win in the end .
do you mean that the gap between the american team and other teams is narrowing ?
yes . that &apos;s the fact .
good morning , richard .
morning , philip .
come in , please .
would you like some tea or coffee ?
coffee , please .
thanks .
richard , the olympic basketball matches are scheduled to begin tomorrow .
can you enlighten me on that ?
my pleasure .
what do you want to know ?
some basic knowledge .
first , could you tell me how many kinds of pass are there ?
at least 20 .
long pass , short pass , bounce pass , low-hand snap pass , shoulder pass , lob pass , to name just a few .
are there as many kinds of press as pass ?
no .
we have full-court press , half-court press , zone press , one-man press and two-man press .
what about the screen ?
there are five kinds of screen : forth screen , back screen , side screen , stationary screen and moving screen .
can you explain the thirty-second rule to me ?
once a team has gained control of the ball , it must shoot within thirty seconds .
what constitutes a personal foul ?
many cases might be judged a personal foul . blocking an opponent who does not have the ball , obstruction , pushing , charging , grabbing , and hand to hand contact when an opponent is shooting are among the most common personal fouls .
thank you , richard .
the rules are too complex for me .
if you can get me a ticket for the match , i &apos;ll take the trouble to accompany you and explain to you on the spot .
the chinese women &apos;s basketball team put on its bestever performance last night , routing cuba by nearly 40 points to reach the final of 25th olympic games .
it &apos;s wonderful .
what &apos;s the result ?
109 : 70 .
it is of a margin rarely seen in women &apos;s basketball .
which team will china play against for gold medal ?
the unified team .
they upset the united states by 79 : 73 in the other semifinal .
this is the first time that either chinese men &apos;s or women &apos;s basketball team has reached final in a major world tournament .
what &apos;s chinese women team &apos;s previous best result ?
their previous best result was a bronze medal at the los angeles olympic games and a third place in the 1986 world championships .
this time will the china &apos;s best chance .
yes , it is .
cuba beat the unified team in the preliminary round and we beat cuba .
but beating their conquerors does not necessarily mean we could beat them .
i agree .
the unified team is a very dangerous rival because their centers are very strong and effective .
our morale is very high . we will wait and see .
ma jian is going for the first asian in nba .
who is ma jian ?
he is former chinese basketball forward who has spent five years on the chinese national team .
does he play basketball now ?
yes .
he is on the basketball team of university of utah in the united states .
how is he getting on there ?
he averaged 17.9 points a game last season for his team .
that &apos;s not bad .
how is the nba action going this season without michael jordan ?
it &apos;s going well .
a new star is rising .
who is it ?
o &apos;neal of orlando .
he is almost taking the place of jordan .
is that so ?
how did he play this season ?
he leads the nba with 2805 points a game and could be the first center to win the scoring the since abdul jabbar in 1972 .
how about his rebounds and blocked shots ?
his 12 rebounds and 3 blocked shots a game are among the nba best .
i suppose he is very rich , isn &apos;t he ?
you &apos;re quite right on this point . he is in the second season of a seven-year , $ 40 million contract .
he also has endorsement deal worth at least $ 20 million .
how tall is he ?
2.1 m .
so he is a very big man .
yes , he is . he &apos;s 135 kilograms .
he collapsed a backboard support in his first nba appearance on television , delaying the game 45 minutes .
oh , that &apos;s so funny .
did you watch the nba action last night ?
no , i didn &apos;t what &apos;s on ?
the dallas mavericks lost their 19th consecutive game .
well , that is only one game short of the nba record in one season .
then , who is holding the futility record of nba ?
philadelphia set a record of 20 consecutive defeats in 1973 in the same season and cleveland lost 24 straight games in 1982 over a two-season span .
it is said that magic johnson will return to nba to coach the los angeles lakers . is it right ?
yes .
and randy pfund has been relieved of his head coaching duties , hasn &apos;t he ?
really ?
how long has pfund been with the lakers ?
two years .
i heard that he had signed a one-year contract extension with the team through 1995 - 1996 season .
but the boss of the club changed his mind .
he hired the magic .
johnson just retired from the lakers , didn &apos;t he ?
yes , he led the lakers to five nba championships in his 12 seasons with the team .
wonderful , then why did he retire ?
he retired after learning he was infected with the virus .
harry and joe play on the same basketball team for their university .
they have just won a game against another university , as they are leaving the court , they are talking about the game .
jees !
what a game . i love playing man-to-man defence , when i can keep my guy from scoring .
yeh !
if we had been playing zone defence , i don &apos;t think we would have beaten them by so much . we might only have tied , and then gone into overtime .
oh !
i don &apos;t know . but after you hit that long jump-shot in the first quarter , i knew we were going to win by intuition .
did you really ?
well , their , play was too loose . they should have played a tighter game . their defence seemed confused , uncoordinated , and their center didn &apos;t seem to know what their forwards were doing . those guys were all over the court .
i noticed that too . their guards didn &apos;t seem to be guarding anyone .
hey !
but when those guys were on the offensive , they were mean . they kept cutting through our defence as if we were sleeping .
but they did nothing after they had gotten through our defence . i lost count of the number of air-balls those guys put up .
do you remember their number 10 putting up a shot form the free-throwline , in the second quarter ?
of cause i remember , i was the guy blocking him . he threw a brick because he was trying to avoid me .
i haven &apos;t seen a brick that big since i was in junior high school . that was bad playing .
what happened with that free-throw you got after their guard came up from behind , and hit you ?
i missed the ball . it &apos;s really a shame .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll practise my free-throw shots a little more .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll improve this skill as long as you practise hard , let &apos;s analyze it , ok ?
it was a rebound . you were on the free-throw line , and the ball didn &apos;t even touch the hoop .
it bounced off the backboard straightly into their possession . if you &apos;d just put it up a little softer , it might have dropped into the key , so that one of our guys could have tipped it in , at least we would have scored .
hey !
we all put up bad shots , and good ones too .
i also got a slamdunk in that game . that isn &apos;t what i call bad playing .
true .
that is something i have never managed to do during any game . the feeling must be amazing .
so that &apos;s what you were doing .
i noticed you sit in the key and wait for a pass . were you trying to slamdunk ?
no , i was just trying to be in the right place at the right time . waiting for a pass , and watching the clock so that i wouldn &apos;t foul .
do you remember when the referee said you &apos;d been traveling with the ball ?
i had just tapped the ball to you after that jump-ball and you &apos;d dribbled it through their defence on you own . then the referee called a penalty , and said you were traveling . he gave possession to the other team .
yes . i was just about to pass it to our number 5 .
let it be , we won the game , and we really beat them .
do you want to practise still more next sunday ?
okay !
you can teach me how to hit me ones from inside the key and i can teach you how to hit the long ones from outside the three-point line .
okay !
let &apos;s learn from each other and improve ourselves . you can perhaps help me improve my dribbling skills too . deal ?
deal .
how about getting the team together for a half-court bull-fight ?
then if we go a few hours earlier , maybe we can practise a little more .
sounds good . see you on sunday .
be there , or be square .
the dishes are delicious . and the coffee , too . i really enjoy them . thank you so much .
not at all .
er . pamela .
did you watch tv last night ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
i hardly watch television .
pamela .
i did . it &apos;s the nba game . the match yesterday was between france and germany . it was so exciting .
pamela .
yes , both teams played well .
actually , i once though of ringing you , but i didn &apos;t .
why ?
because it was so exciting .
all the fans shouted and clapped and cheered so much that you could hardly hear anything .
and i know how much you like basketball .
no , i don &apos;t . i hate it .
why ?
but i remember you were very good at it in school !
i can still see you catching the ball and passing it .
and was it a long pass ?
yes .
and also short pass , overhead pass and the excellent rolling pass .
but i was often fouled .
yes . you used to steal the ball .
no , that &apos;s intercepting .
and you once fouled because of striking .
yes . i did .
but we boys always had a good team work .
now i &apos;m not interested in it . listen , pamela .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you look as white as a piece of paper .
is there anything wrong ?
yes . i &apos;m afraid there is .
i &apos;ve got something to tell you .
what ?
please call a spade a spade .
i &apos;m very sorry . i didn &apos;t bring any money on me . i can &apos;t pay the bill .
what do you usually do in your spare time , mr. white ?
i enjoy playing basketball . i usually play basketball on holidays .
i think you are good at it . but don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a waste of time ?
i am afraid i don &apos;t agree with you .
i like doing many kinds of exercise , especially playing basketball . it is good for my health as well as for the mind .
more , you can learn a lot from basketball .
what can we learn from it then ?
do you know how many defences there are ?
one , i think .
just watch closely !
no , there are six defences altogether : ① man-to-man defence ; ② 5 - man defence ; ③ combination defence ; ④ close watch ; ⑤ full court and double team pass ; ⑥ zone press .
what is combination defence ?
the combination defence has zone box , or two-and-two defence .
how many kinds of zone defence are there ?
zone defence are : two-one-two zone defence , three-one-one zone defence , three-two zone defence , two-three zone defence , and one-two-two defence or one-three-one defence .
well , i didn &apos;t know so much about basketball , thank you .
you are welcome .
what i said just now is only a little .
i &apos;ve heard of &quot; attacks &quot; , how many kinds of attacks are there ?
they are : the past break , one-one-one playroll attack , single -post attack , positiongame , one-three-one offence , three-two formation . two-three offensive formation , reverse post and screen .
after hearing what you said , i made a new opinion towards playing basketball .
maybe , to some extent , it &apos;s a kind of art .
you are right . the players should practise more if they want to win a basketball game . we believe that practice makes perfect .

oh.gosh , it is .
let &apos;s play it tomorrow , ok ?
ok .
do you come here a lot ?
i try to come here at least three times a week .
my wife keeps telling me i have to hose weight-otherwise she &apos;s going to find a new husband .
you &apos;re kidding !
yeah .
but seriously , if don &apos;t exercise , i easily gain weight .
i should have asked the trainer , but can you tell me which machine is good to exercise my back ?
sure .
come over here .
congratulations .
thank you .
i never thought i would win the contest .
you deserve it . now i &apos;ll buy you a victory lunch .
thank you . i must admit that i &apos;m hungry .
good . let &apos;s go .
second serve .
yeah .
give me a good serve this time .
serving is the toughest part of the game .
you just need to practice more .
i practice my serve all the time .
but always hit the net .
maybe you should take tennis lessons .
that &apos;s what i did .
second serve .
yeah , give me a good serve this time .
serving is the toughest part of the game .
you just need to practice more .
i practice my serve all the time .
but always hit the net .
maybe you should take tennis lessons .
that &apos;s what i did .
you hotel brochure shows there are some tennis courts in your hotel .
is it true ?
yes , we have two tennis courts at the back of this wing .
whom should i contact to play tennis ?
please contact that information desk at the corner of the lobby . they can take booking .
can i play tennis this afternoon ?
no , sir .
this afternoon is fully booked .
it will be ok if it &apos;s tomorrow .
what time is available ?
any time you want .
would you fix it at 8 o &apos;clock ?
2 hours .
and how much is it ?
i think you have a tennis racket , and then the fee is 7 dollars per person .
do you like to play tennis ?
yes , i like it very much .
when do you play tennis ?
i play tennis with my friends on sunday afternoons .
i guess you are an expert .
no , i am not .
but you &apos;re a good player , aren &apos;t you ?
well , anyway , why don &apos;t you play tennis with me next sunday ?
why not ?
but we have to rent a court .
do you know any court still open ?
i &apos;ll let you know over the phone as soon as i can reserve a court .
great !
can i take my parents at that time ?
they often played tennis when they were young .
sure .
i &apos;d love to see them .
thanks !
great game .
i only won by luck . you were an excellent opponent .
no. it was a close match , but you deserved to win .
your serve was perfect . the way you served the ball confused me every time . you played two ace-shots as well .
it might have confused you , but you still managed to return it with force most of the time .
it was difficult at times .
after you had sliced the ball on your serve , i had to run all over the court trying to return it .
then i could only return it as a flat-shot , and easy opportunity for you to slice again .
you played a few as well .
you often spun the ball so much .
it nearly burnt a hole through my racket .
i think you &apos;ve been watching too many cartoons . that &apos;s the only place where you can hit an overhead-shot , and put so much spin on the ball , that the opponent has to run for two kilometers outside the stadium to return it .
your volley-shots were like that . you played a forehand-stroke . i never knew where the ball would go .
yes . but a lot of those didn &apos;t work .
the umpire called &quot; out &quot; so many times when i hit the ball with a forehand-stroke .
and when i played those overhead power-shots , i wanted to shoot her .
yes . she did the same to me when i volleyed the ball . a lot of times when i played the ball on the volley , i heard the word &quot; out &quot; shouted . i felt like throwing her out of the stadium .
let &apos;s go out for some exercise .
that &apos;s a good idea .
do you like to play tennis ?
it &apos;s my favorite sport .
do you play often ?
at least twice a week .
are you a good player ?
no. just an average player .
what about you ?
are you good at tennis ?
i am a very poor hand at tennis , but i am very fond of it .
ok . now let &apos;s go to the court and have a match .
it &apos;s out .
it was almost in , but it &apos;s definitely out .
are you sure ?
from my angle that shot looked good .
it &apos;s hard to tell . i really think the ball was out .
well , i really think the ball was in .
ok , how about if we just serve the ball over again and replay the point ?
yeah , that sounds fair to me .
the service of tennis is too complex for me to understand .
yes , the service and scoring rules are difficult to me , too .
but i happen to know the basic rules of service .
the server stands behind his own baseline , to one side of the center mark , and then hits the ball over the net into whichever service court is diagonally opposite .
how about that for the first point of the game ?
for the first point of each game , the server stands to the right of the center mark to serve , for the second , to the left , for the third back to the right , and so on alternately .
what &apos;s a fault in tennis ?
if the ball doesn &apos;t cross the net , or it doesn &apos;t first hit the ground in the correct service court , it is a faulty service .
the one who makes such a fault is to lose the right to serve , isn &apos;t he ?
no . he will serve once more .
if he fails again ?
double fault leads to the server losing the point even though his opponent has not even had to return the ball .
if the second attempt is successful and the opponent failed to return it , the server wins the point .
i see .
i have another question to ask you . mr. li .
what is it ?
when i watch a tennis match on tv , i often heard &quot; let &quot; . and i wonder what a &quot; let &quot; is .
if the service ball touches the net , but still goes into the correct service court , it is called a &quot; let &quot; . this means that the service is taken again .
what will happen if it was the first attempt ?
if it was the first attempt , the server still has two attempts to make a good service .
thank you for your explanation .
please don &apos;t stand on ceremony .
the scoring system in tennis is confusing .
yes .
but in fact it is quite simple .
however , i don &apos;t know about it .
don &apos;t worry . let me make it clear for you .
in each game , a player begins with no score , called &quot; love &quot; . the first point he wins in the game gives him a total score of 15 . the second brings the total to 30 , the third to 40 . after this , the next point wins him the game unless his opponent also reaches 40 , in which case , one of them has to get a two-point lead to win .
jennifer capriati , the new tennis star , lost in the opening set at us open .
who beat her ?
leila maskhi from the republic of georgia .
it is said that capriati is seventh-seeded at the us open , isn &apos;t she ?
yes .
she is .
this loss may be the worst one of her career .
this is the first time capriati has fallen in the opening round of a grand slam event .
what &apos;s her age ?
17 .
she is still young . she &apos;s a promising player .
i often hear people talk about michael chang . how about his playing ?
er . he was the youngest tennis player ever who won the french open . he was only 17 .
that &apos;s quite an achievement .
not only that . he has been in the second place in the world rankings .
i wonder why he &apos;s so popular in asia .
it &apos;s not difficult to understand .
you see , he &apos;s chinese and he &apos;s lean and shot when compared to most other to players like sampras and agassi and yet he &apos;s able to outmatch them in some games .
he &apos;s the hope of many people who like him , being not athletic and tall .
i agree .
watching his game is never boring .
you see him doing his best to chase after the ball .
we can almost feel his explosive energy just watching him play .
that &apos;s why so many people like to watch him play . a lot of them can identify with him . too bad we don &apos;t have many tennis courts in hong kong .
yes , we do .
the government has been opening quite a few new tennis courts in recent years .
yeah , but still you have to book a place in advance .
even so it &apos;s better than nothing .
we have a popular saying in our country : &quot; all work and no play makes jack a dull boy . &quot;
we all believe that everybody needs recreation .
we cannot work all the time if we want to maintain good health .
you &apos;re quite right !
i think everyone has his own way of relaxing .
perhaps the most popular way is to participate in sports .
when i was young , for recreation , i liked to play tennis in the summer .
my favourite winter sport was skiing .
you also have a favourite sport , don &apos;t you ?
yes , my favourite sport is badminton .
sometimes , i also play table tennis , or go swimming .
many people enjoy sporting events , but they do not like to participate in them .
chess , card-playing , and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by people old and young .
are you a good dancer ?
not quite .
at my age , i like jogging .
i think it is a very good exercise .
it &apos;s a pity i haven &apos;t had much time for exercise lately .
i &apos;m afraid i am putting on weight .
that serves as a timely warning !
you must try your best to reduce weight .
indonesia is really a powerhouse of badminton .
how come ?
they have clinched all four semi-final berths for men at the famous $ 125000 all england open .
who are the four entering the final four ?
top seed ardy , world silver medallist susanto , olympic champion kusuma and defending champion arbi .
why did their top player suprianto fail to make the final four ?
oh , not &quot; fail &quot; , but because of his shoulder injury , he didn &apos;t come .
who won the title , anyhow ?
the defending champion arbi succeeded in retaining the trophy .

damn it !
the shuttlecock stopped short in its flight and plunged down into my court .
you should run to return it before it hits the ground .
now hit it sharply downward . how can i return such a strong shot ?
ok .
attention please !
i &apos;ll let it fly in a high arc and then fall gently this time . now hit it forcefully . ah-ya !
i didn &apos;t miss it . the frame of my racket touched it .
that &apos;s wrong . you should not let the frame hit the shuttlecock .
good morning , country club .
may i help you ?
yes , can i have a badminton court this afternoon ?
i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t accept telephone reservation . please come over to make your booking .
i see .
can i ask if there is any court free this afternoon ?
badminton court ?
that &apos;s right .
yes .
there &apos;s one available this afternoon .
thanks a lot .
can i have a badminton court at three , please ?
let me see . i &apos;m sorry that the courts are fully booked today .
what !
that is too bad .
do you have any court tomorrow then ?
yes , we do .
we have three and five in the afternoon .
ji xinpeng is an excellent shuttler .
the way he kept returning the shuttle really impressed me .
yes .
he is incomparable in many respects-serving , volleying , swipe , and smash .
in the final , ji xinpeng and hendrawan rallied for about 20 turns before ji xinpeng scored one point .
thrilling !
the shuttle flew so quickly that i could hardly keep its track and both the players displayed their outstanding speed , stamina , and agility .
they are both good at serving .
the way they dropped the shuttle onto the racket is perfect .
but i remember hendrawan served it out one time and he had to pass the serve to ji xinpeng a couple of times , because he hit a couple of net-shots when he tried to swipe .
homer sometimes nods .
but hendrawan is excellent at playing overhead stokes and underarm strokes .
it was really a wonderful match .
if only i could watch them play again .
do you know what are the main international badminton competitions ?
yes .
the main international competitions are the all-england badminton championships , the thomas cup , and the uber cup .
when were the first all-england championships held then ?
they were held in 1899 .
well , they have a long history , aren &apos;t they ?
ye , but it has been only 8 years since badminton was included in the olympics .
really ?
well , let me calculate . yes , eight years ago , so it became a full olympic sport in 1992 .
that &apos;s right . at the barcelona olympics in 1992 .
what do you think of the standard of the top chinese badminton players ?
i think they are among the best in the world .
however , we should not be complacent , and should always try to improve standards even more .
meanwhile china should have a development program for young players .
do you know why badminton is so strong in indonesia ?
yes .
badminton is the major sport in indonesia .
the country has a long tradition in the sport and pays much attention to the development of badminton .
i think badminton must be the most popular sport in indonesia .
so do i.
but it is also very popular in china .
we can often see people play this game in front it their houses or on the playground .
they usually play in singles .
it is very convenient to play in this way .
so it is .
i think badminton is great fun . it is fast and tricky .
yes , and it &apos;s physically demanding too . you can be easily exhausted if you &apos;re not in a good shape , especially when you play single .
i see .
i never prefer to play single . running back and forth and smashing are killing me .
but you see , the trick of playing a sport well is trying to outwit you opponent .
if your opponent is tall and strong , you have to play it wise .
both ira and hilary love exercise .
now , it is sunday night and they have just finished a match of badminton in singles .
they are tired , but are happily talking about the match .
it was fun . thanks .
so was it . you &apos;re and excellent opponent . the way you kept returning the birdie , and kept the rally going . really impressed me .
i think we rallied for about 20 turns at point during the game .
closer to 30 turns , i think . that rally exhausted me , and you were the one who ended it .
what do you mean ?
you missed the birdie .
it was because of your excellent playing
but it was your serve , so unfortunately i didn &apos;t get a point .
those me the rules of the game . the sever gets the point . and it was my turn to serve .
servers are something you are good at . the way you drop the birdie onto the racket is perfect .
and the way you always hit it just below your waistline looks so professional .
but i did make one mistake . i remembered serving it out one time . i also passed the serve to you a couple of times , because i hit a couple of net-shots when i tried swiping .
i &apos;m not too good at swiping either . i often swiped the birdie into the net just as you did .
i think i &apos;m better at playing overhead strokes . and i felt more confident using a forehand overhead-stroke than a backhand one .
it always goes out if i use the backhand-overhead-stroke .
i &apos;m the same with underarm strokes , especially my underarm-forehand stroke .
each time i had to use it to save , the birdie went to high you easily smashed it back .
i love playing those . you can aim the birdie close to sideline .
and the feeling when it hits the court , and the umpire says it was &quot; in &quot; is great . it is the best of the game .
and when he says it &apos;s &quot; out &quot; , my feelings got troubled . fortunately , i didn &apos;t get too many faults in that match , so i was happy .
well it was a close match . but you deserved to win , and you did .
no , i though you would .
we were tying from the start . the score quickly went to a one all tie . then two-one , then we were tying again at two all .
at the end of the game as well . we were on deuce for quite a while . first , you got the advantage point . then i won the next point to take it back to deuce again .
i only got the two advantage points i needed by luck . either of us could have won .
would you like a doubles game sometime ?
okay .
but i don &apos;t know who i could ask to be my partner . i &apos;ll ask michael , then we can have a mixed doubles game . all right ?
remember to give me a call .
i hear the final of women &apos;s single of badminton is to take place this evening at 8 : 00 . who are the two players ?
guo zhichao from china and camilla martin from denmark .
you know , dora , i know nothing about badminton .
will you give me some information and answer some of my questions ?
i &apos;d love to .
asian countries such as china , indonesia , and malaysia have the best shuttlers .
they have consecutively won the medals at the olympics .
i guess ms.gong zhichao from china is most likely to be the winner in the final .
what are your questions ?
first , i &apos;d like to know something about the service .
in single , the server begins in the right serve court and serves to his or her opponent in the opposite right service court .
if the server wins a rally , he or she scores a point .
the next serve is from the left service court .
a player can only win points when he is serving .
what are the basic skills for playing badminton ?
i think the players should be skilled at serving , volleying , the backhand smash , the forehand smash and the drop shot .
do the players change ends ?
yes , they change ends after each game , and also half way through the third game .
how many points is the winner to get before one set ends ?
as for double and men &apos;s single , that &apos;s 15 . as for women &apos;s single , that &apos;s 11 .
i remember that you &apos;ve once mentioned &quot; foot fault . &quot;
what is it ?
neither the server nor the receiver can move his or her feet until the server &apos;s racket has hit the shuttle .
if one moves , he or she will be judged to have committed a foot fault .
i once heard the expression &quot; five to love &quot; or something like that . what &apos;s the meaning ?
that &apos;s five to zero .
in sports , love means nil .
interesting .
that was fun . thanks .
me too . you &apos;re an excellent opponent . the way you kept returning the birdie , and kept the rally going , really impressed me .
i think we rallied for about 30 turns at point during the game .
closer to 40 turns , i think . that rally exhausted me , and you were the one who ended it .
what do you mean ?
you missed the birdie .
because of your excellent playing .
but it was your serve , so unfortunately i didn &apos;t get a point .
those are the rules of the game . the server gets the point . and it was my serve .
serves are something you are good at . the way you drop the birdie onto the racket is perfect .
and the way you always hit it just below your waistline , looks so professional .
i did make one mistake . i remember serving it out one time , i also had to pass the serve to you a couple of times , because i hit a couple of net-shots when i tried to swipe .
i &apos;m not too good at swiping either . i often swiped the birdie into the net as well .
i think i &apos;m better at playing overhead strokes . and i felt more confident using a forehand-overhead-stroke than a backhand one .
it often goes out if i use the backhand-overhead-stroke .
i &apos;m the same with underarm strokes , especially my underarm forehand stroke .
each time i had to use it to save , the birdie went to high you easily smashed it back .
i love playing those . you can aim the birdie close to sideline .
and the feeling when it hits the court , and the umpire says it was &quot; in &quot; is great . it is the best of the game .
hello , john !
where are you coming from ?
from a football match .
the london team played against the oxford team .
and what &apos;s the score ?
two to one in favour of the london team .
how is it that so strong a team as the oxford team lost to the london team ?
the london forwards were in excellent form and their goalkeeper did his job splendidly .
were there some other causes that led to the loss of the oxford team ?
one of the oxford team &apos;s best players was injured and was replaced by another who proved to be a poor makeshift .
what a pity !
who acted as the referee ?
bob smith did .
he knows his job all right .
it was the london team that opened the score , and the score remained to be 1 : 0 until the very end of the first half when the oxford team scored its first goal .
as i understand , the first half ended in a draw .
yes , it did .
during the second half , the oxford team &apos;s half-back , who was at fault , was ordered off the field , and thus , the oxford team had to play against the london team with its 10 players .
when did the london team score the second goal ?
towards the end of the second half .
when on of the players of the oxford team was a fault , the referee suspended the game and ordered a penalty kick .
and that penalty kick brought the london team another score .
right you are !
there are more professional football clubs in england than anywhere else in the world .
there are four divisions in the english league system .
well , a few years ago bristol city football club was in the first division . now they &apos;re in the fourth division .
the biggest problem &apos;s finance .
i believe three or four years ago this club paid a quarter of a million pounds for a player , and the team that are playing now for the city are all players that have cost no money .
they &apos;re all what we call free transfers .
and that &apos;s the biggest difference , that we can &apos;t go and buy quality players .
we &apos;ve got to get people that cost nothing , and try and get a successful team doing it that way .
we &apos;ve got a lot of young players , and my job is to encourage them and get them to play .
so that direction .
i mean , what are your immediate aims for the group ?
well , we &apos;re there already .
we &apos;re top of the fourth division at the minute .
it &apos;s a bit early in the season , but if we can stop in the stop four of the fourth division and get promotion for the club .
. we &apos;re getting great crowds now .
we had nearly eleven thousand here tuesday night , which is fabulous .
that &apos;s bigger crowds than second division teams are getting .
at the minute the club is bubbling . it &apos;s been through a bad time . it &apos;s . it &apos;s had a big crisis .
we think we &apos;ve sorted the finance out , we &apos;re trying to live within a tight budget and get success , which is difficult ; but at the minute we &apos;re on the up and we &apos;ve got to keep going that way if possible .
can i ask you what you think about the club &apos;s situation ?
well , i think the past fifteen months we &apos;ve been getting through the problems . it was fifteen , eighteen months ago that we took over the problems .
and these were problems which had occurred .
a classic case , really , of a club which and success and then quickly came to failure .
and they left behind long-term contracts , high wages , for a club that had failed and removed themselves from the first division right the way down to the fourth division ; and no way could they pay their way .
and then we had to take drastic steps ; and these were , in fact , to get rid of those long-contract players who had very high wages .
and that was the point at which this club turned round . it was very unhappy at the time .
there &apos;s nothing worse than getting rid of players , you know , who had given this club good service .
we had a new board , new people came through .
we set up a consortium whereby we could sort out the debts of the old club .
and through , sort of , through good management i think we &apos;ve been lucky to get a good manager - we &apos;ve managed to turn the whole thing round .
and right at this moment we &apos;re sitting right at the top of the fourth division . i know it &apos;s the fourth of four divisions , but we &apos;re going the right way .
so where do you see the club a year from now ?
good question .
if i had a crystal ball , you know , i could tell you exactly .
but i feel very confident that we are going to make it this year from the fourth to the third .
one would hope that this time next year we &apos;re right at the top and moving into the second division .
and then , believe you me , the big problems start , because once you &apos;re in the second division you want to go in the first division , and the we &apos;re back where we started .
the big money comes back into it then - how can we afford these players ?
and when you get into the first division , you &apos;re competing with manchester united and liverpool - the big clubs , you know - and it &apos;s very difficult .
but we &apos;re a bit city .
there &apos;s no reason why we shouldn &apos;t go back there .
the best of luck !
thank you very much .
did you go to the football match last saturday ?
certainly !
it was the first match of the season .
what did you think of it ?
very exciting !
which team did you root for ?
i &apos;ve always supported liverpool .
me too .
i wonder if gao hongbuo is playing .
who &apos;s gao hongbuo ?
he &apos;s guo an &apos;s top scorer .
he got a back injury a few weeks ago and hasn &apos;t played since .
there he is !
great !
he &apos;s a brilliant player .
it &apos;s worth coming just to watch his footwork .
i hope he &apos;s on form today .
hey , look ! the police have made a no man &apos;s-land to keep the two groups of fans apart .
is that really necessary ?
yes . they sometimes get very violent .
they &apos;re kicking off .
who do you want to win , pat ?
since i &apos;m with two shen hua supporters , i &apos;d better join you . i don &apos;t want any violence .
core jia is the goalie for shen hua .
i don &apos;t think guo an stands a chance against such a strong team .
did you see that !
what a kick !
from one end of the pitch to the other .
oh , no , guo an &apos;s got the ball .
come on , tang min , take it from them !
the referee has stopped tang min .
oh , foul !
that means a penalty kick for guo an .
they &apos;ve scored . it &apos;s a goal .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m sure shen hua will win .
they haven &apos;t warmed up yet .
look , tang min &apos;s got the ball !
come on , tang min !
what a beautiful pass !
he &apos;s fallen ! oh , no !
it &apos;s his back again . he &apos;s out of the game .
do you still think shen hua will win ?
what time is it now ?
it &apos;s half past four .
when will the football finals begin , do you know ?
at six o &apos;clock sharp .
it must be very exciting , i think .
yes , i think so .
have you got any tickets ?
i have just one ticket .
you are lucky . i have to go and watch tv .

that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t see you .
your football team did so well , especially the third goal . that was so great .
yes , but it wasn &apos;t easy to win the match . the visiting team is really strong .

i &apos;ve been playing soccer for five years .

look , mack .
america takes the 4-3-2 formation while germany takes 4-4-2 .
america seems more aggressive .
i see .
is no.9 the player you admire most ?
yes . norbert is the point man in the midfield and the striker .
germany is sure to mark him closely .
but he has his own way .
there , william .
the american forward no.3 goes around a defender .
he centers the ball to the right side of the penalty area .
nice pass .
another american forward is penetrating fast .
the pass is plucked .
the german team &apos;s defense is well organized .
good chance !
but the germans rush out of the ball to the goal .
the german outside-right lobs the ball to the goal .
they all challenge to head the ball .
the goalkeeper punches the ball away .
the german team gets the ball .
shot !
there &apos;s the first goal . no.8 did it .
one to nil in favor of germany .
america lacks punch in the midfield .
norbert . norbert is thrusting down the middle . he dribbles past a fullback .
ah !
he &apos;s tripped .
the german no.10 plays that rough .
he should be shown a yellow card .
that &apos;s it . he pays for it .
a free kick near the penalty area .
the goalkeeper is organizing to build up a wall .
norbert takes the kick .
what a great shot !
norbert is great .
did you hear the evening news last night ?
yes , i did . there was a piece of good news on it .
roberto baggio of juventus was voted player of the year , do you mean this ?
of course .
he is worthy of the honour .
i agree .
when i heard the new , i was very excited as if i myself were honoured .
me too .
i think that &apos;s because baggio is our favorite star .
we have paid so much attention to him .
that &apos;s quite right .
i hope he could have greater achievements .
sure .
let &apos;s wait and see .
what do you think about the standard of play of chinese national football team ?
i think it is very low .
there are many shortcomings of chinese soccer , aren &apos;t there ?
yes .
firstly , it is lack of basic football skills .
secondly , the teamwork is inadequate .
thirdly , the ability to score goals is quite poor .
well , there &apos;s a long way to go for chinese national football team .
good news for chinese soccer fans .

what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
football , of course .
today it &apos;s probably the most popular sport in the world .
can you explain the world cup ?
well .
the cup is a series of games in which teams from many countries play to see which is the best .
where was the cup held for the first time ?
the world cup began in montevideo , uruguay , in 1930 .
how often is the cup held ?
every four years .
has it ever been canceled due to some reasons ?
no .
but there were no world cup championships in 1942 or 1946 because of world war ii .
the cup itself was hidden during the war .
the beautiful cup is about ten inches high and has the shape of nike , the greek goddess of victory , on it .
you have very rich knowledge about football , i think you have given me an interesting lesson .
look !
the teams are coming onto the field .
have you ever seen argentina ?
no , never , i don &apos;t like football very much , i like basketball .
really ?
you don &apos;t like football ?
that &apos;s strange .
then you must have never seen a professional football game .
yes .
but i have seen nba .
so you &apos;re sure to be a basketball fan , and i &apos;m a football one .
that &apos;s quite right .
excuse me , do you know which ones are argentina ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve never paid attention to them .
ah , yes .
they &apos;re in red and white .
who &apos;s kicking off ?
it &apos;s brazil .
are both teams good ?
of course .
it must be a very wonderful game .
which one is better then ?
generally speaking , brazil is usually better than argentina .
but this year argentina is the best in the division .
do they ever lose ?
oh yes .
they sometimes lost but they usually win .
they don &apos;t often have a bad day this year .
which team do you support ?
i &apos;ve always been supporting argentina .
my father is also a football fan . but it seems that he has never liked argentina .
which team does he like then ?
italy .
they haven &apos;t scored yet . what &apos;s wrong ?
be patient .
they &apos;re only been on the field for half an hour . this is only the first half .
you are right .
they have much hope .
hello , tony .
i &apos;m told your team is going to play in the championship cup final on saturday .
you hope to win the league cup for the fourth time next saturday .
but arsenal is a hard team to beat .
what do you think of your chances ?
well , li nan , i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll win .
arsenal is a very strong team , but we &apos;ve never been better than we are today .
well , i wish you the best of luck for saturday .
by the way , tell me about your future . what will you be doing in five years &apos; time ?
i hope i &apos;ll still be playing football in five years &apos; time .
even in ten years &apos; time , when i have to retire from playing , i still don &apos;t want to leave football .
i &apos;d really like to train young footballers . i don &apos;t know for sure , but i always want to work in football .
good .
it &apos;s been nice talking to you , tony .
i &apos;ll be watching the match saturday .
thanks .
good-bye .
bye-bye .
hello .
hello , cai qi ?
yes .
deng jun !
how are you ?
cool .
your team is going to play against the diamond team for the final next monday .
right . so i call you just hoping that you and liu yin will go and watch the match .
bullshit !
i shout for you , thousands wouldn &apos;t !
what about your better half ?
zhou qin &apos; ll take you to the stadium .
great !
play hard , man !
i will .
i will try my heart out .
i &apos;ll keep my fingers crossed for you .
thank you !
good-bye .
bye !
what a big crowd !
there must be 20 000 people here .
it &apos;s lucky for us to have reserved seats .
where are our seats ?
row a , number 16 to 18 .
that &apos;s right in the front .
we &apos;ll have to push through the crowd to get to them . excuse me . excuse me . do you mind . sorry . excuse me . well , here we are at last .
what splendid seats !
we &apos;ll be able to see everything from here .
yes .
deng jun has certainly looked after us well .
we &apos;ll have to take him out to dinner after the match .
gook idea , liu yin , we certainly must .
just for celebrating the victory .
the boss team needs to beat the diamond team to get pass for the final .
but the diamond only needs a draw .
so it will make or break the boss team .
as the captain of the boss team , deng jun feels the pressure .
don &apos;t worry .
i told him he must play hard because his better half is watching him .
you mustn &apos;t talk nonsense like that .
here are the teams coming out .
deng jun is leading the boss team .
deng jun lost the toss and the diamond captain has decided to play with the wind .
oh well , they &apos;ll have to play against the wind in the second half .
deng jun is playing centre forward .
he &apos;s just getting ready to kick off .
there they go .
come on , boss !
hello , john ! where are you coming from ?
from a football match .
the london team played against the oxford team .
and what &apos;s the score ?
two to one in favor of the london team .
how is it that so strong a team as the oxford team lost to the london team ?
the london forwards were in excellent form and their goalkeeper did his job splendidly .
were there some other causes that led to the loss of the oxford team ?
one of the oxford team &apos;s best players was injured and was replaced by another who proved to be a poor makeshift .
what a pity !
who acted as the referee ?
bob smith did .
he knows his job all right .
it was the london team that opened the score , and the score remained to be 1 : 0 until the very end of the first half when the oxford team scored its first goal .
as i understand , the first half ended in a draw .
yes , it did .
during the second half , the oxford team &apos;s halfback , who was at fault , was ordered off the field , and thus , the oxford team had to play against the london team with its 10 players .
when did the london team score the second goal ?
towards the end of the second half .
when one of the players of the oxford team was a fault , the referee suspended the game and ordered a penalty kick .
and that penalty kick brought the london team another score .
right you are !
what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
football , of course .
today it &apos;s probably the most popular sport in the world .
can you explain the world cup ?
well .
the cup is a series of games in which teams from many countries play to see which is the best .

the cup itself was hidden during the war .
the beautiful cup is about ten inches high and has the shape of nike , the greek goddess of victory , on it .
you have very rich knowledge about football ;
i think you have given me an interesting lesson .
would you like to play some soccer with us ?
sure , that sounds like fun .
do you have a soccer ball ?
yes , i &apos;ll bring it .
do you know where to find a good soccer field ?
yes , there &apos;s a good field next to campus .
how long have you been playing soccer ?
i &apos;ve been playing soccer for five years .
could you teach me how to play ?
certainly .
man , this place is big !
it has to be .
soccer is the number one sport throughout europe .
in the states we have the big three : baseball , football , and basketball , but there &apos;s only the big one here in europe : soccer .
can you play soccer , evan ?
i never have .
i think my high school had a team , but i went out for baseball .
did you join any sports teams in school , kathy ?
in high school i went out for track . the 400-and 800-meter runs .
wow !
those are tough races .
yeah .
that &apos;s probably why i didn &apos;t do very well at them .
it &apos;s more important to enjoy the game and get stronger from sports than to perform well in them .
were you a good baseball player ?
i was so-so .
anyway , let &apos;s exercise a little .
hello , tom .
do you want to go to the football match with me tonight ? i know football is your favorite sport .
here &apos;s a ticket and to spare . it &apos;s also a good seat in the grandstand .
wonderful !
i &apos;d love to go .
by the way , who &apos;s playing ?
italy versus brazil . it &apos;s the final of the olympic games .
are you sure one hundred percent ?
you know i &apos;m a brazil-supporter . i do hope romario is going to play tonight .
you are too excited , tom .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll find out him in the game , i hear he &apos; one of key scorers of the brazilian team .
but what i &apos;m interested in most is who will win the olympic games .
we can imagine all the players going to their best , but i hope brazil will win the game , it must be a wonderful game .
let &apos;s go earlier after supper .
i agree .
i can &apos;t wait to see the game .
can i make a reservation for golf ?
surely .
when do you want to play golf ?
tomorrow .
okay . let me check , first . it will be of if you start at 9 o &apos;clock .
is that all right ?
yes , and how much is it per person ?
20 dollars per person including green fee and round-trip transfers , but 7 dollars for cart is excluded .
do they have a system for rental clubs and shoes ?
they have the rental clubs costing 7 dollars per full set , but i &apos;m not sure about the shoes .
let me check it again on booking .
i wonder if i got your names and room number ?
are you staying at our hotel ?
yes .
mr. wang , mr. lin and my name is jack lee , staying at room number 1245 .
thank you very much , and i &apos;ll leave a message about the rental shoes .
do you like golf ?
i have never tried golf .
i heard it is a sport for the noble . it is very expensive .
but i &apos;m sure it is a very special game .
i know .
but i have good news for you .
in order to promote its real estate , the golden star resort village will open its golf court free for three days beginning from christmas day .
wonderful .
where can we get the ticket ?
is it too late ?
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve already got the tickets .
they are on december the 27th . do you like to go ?
do i like ?
i can &apos;t wait for the day .
it is said that someone has taken drugs to improve his performance at this olympics .
exactly .
i think he has not only lost his own face , but also his nation &apos;s .
and it is very harmful to his own health .
what kinds of harm may it cause ?
it may increase the risk of disease , distorting normal physical growth and development , cancer and mental illness etc .
how terrible !
if drugs win medals , the competition loses its meaning .
i agree .
competition should be between athletes .
how will the matches be played ?
since there are six matches be played , so the single round-robin system will be adopted .
so all the teams will compete in one group and the placings will be determined according to the total points earned ?
yes , two points will be awarded for a win , one point for a tie and zero for a loss .
in that case , we must try hard .
of course , every team will try to perform well .
do you have any programs available ?
yes , here it is .
thank you very much .
good luck to your team .
how many years have you been a coach ?
about 5 years .
and you ?
three years .
what do you think of being a coach ?
it &apos;s good to be coach .
but sometimes i feel very tried .
so do i.
you know a good coach needs experience , knowledge and techniques that an athlete needs .
what &apos;s more , he should be able to get on well with other people including his athletes , the officials of the clubs and other coaches .
you quite right on this point .
but when i see the athletes practicing very hard , i am touched and know that i must devote myself to coaching .
i understand you .
you &apos;re a very good coach , i am sure .
thank you .
let &apos;s learn from each other .
do you like your coach ?
of course .
he has a good sense of humour .
how old is he ?
is he tall ?
he is 32 . he &apos;s quite tall .
i heard that he won a lot of prices when he was an athlete . when he was an athlete .
really ?
he must have been an excellent athlete .
and he &apos;s good coach now .
is he strict with you athletes ?
while training us , he is serious .
but when it &apos;s time for us to have a rest , we usually talk and laugh .
well , though i haven &apos;t seen him , i can imagine what kind of person he is .
look , the one in white is our coach .
wow , how smart he is !
congratulations , mr. yang . in accordance with the general regulations of the games , all medallists are requested to undergo a &quot; dope &quot; test after the final .
oh , i see .
we &apos;d like to have a sample of your urine .
would you please take this small cup with you and bring the sample as soon as possible ?
ok .
10 minutes later
here it is . may i know when i will be informed of the result ?
it has to be delivered to the anti-doping center to be analyzed . we &apos;ll inform you of the result late .
will it take long to have the test done ?
it depends .
but i suggest you attend the victory ceremony first . and thank you for your co-operation .
thank you .
welcome to shanghai . you must have had a long and tiresome flight from sydney , but i &apos;m sorry to tell you that you have to have a steroid test for your players before having their id cards issued .
oh , we are all very tried after such a long flight .
is it possible for us to have the tests tomorrow ?
they badly want to sleep .
i &apos;m afraid not .
with no id cards issued , the players can &apos;t get access to the gymnasium for training .
and women players have to have a steroid test upon arrival at the host country .
oh , i see .
but some players hold the certificates issued by the international volleyball federation . do they also need to have the tests ?
in their case , no .
but they should go through the other formalities first .
but i assure you that doctors shall try to finish the tests as soon as possible .
would you please hand out the forms to the players ?
ok .
now , girls , the doctors are waiting to do the tests , fill in the forms before a test .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s ok .
athletes do exercises a lot .
do most athletes have a healthy diet ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
like most other people in china , they eat too much animal fat and too much salt .
most of them don &apos;t have balanced diet , i think .
that &apos;s terrible .
you know a balanced diet given an athlete the right amount of calories .
that &apos;s quite right .
which do you think is the most important part of an athlete &apos;s diet ?
carbohydrates , which give energy , are the most important part of an athlete &apos;s diet .
where can carbohydrates be found then ?
well , they can be found in starchy foods like sweets and cakes . they can also be found in healthy foods like brown rice and pasta .
you know well about diet and nutrition . how i hope our athletes have some facts about it !
so do i.
don &apos;t you eat vegetables ?
have you ever paid attention to what you eat and drink ?
no , never .

as a dark horse , what &apos;s your idea during your contest ?
in the pool , i tried to feel as if i was just fighting against myself , as if i didn &apos;t have any opponents .
you set a milestone for chinese swimmers in the middle distance swimming to be ranked the world top level .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to attribute my victory to my excellent coach and his scientific training method and my efforts .
how did your training go before you came to this championship ?
i believe in my potential after a year with the national team . and i had altogether swum a total distance of 3200 kilometers this year .

how much is the membership fee ?
it is 60 yuan per month .
no problem , but do i have to be a member ?
no , but members pay less for using the facilities and they have preference over non-members , so they have more access to the facilities .

ok , wait a moment .
ladies and gentlemen , here we are .
i &apos;m your liaison officer . my name is li ping .
during your stay in our city , i will accompany you all the time .
so if you have any questions or problems , please contact me at any time . here is my name card .
excuse me , could you tell me something about the transportation ?
how far is it from the hotel to the venues ?
you are provided with designated buses during the games to the training and competition venues .
it is about 15 minutes &apos; drive .
but sure to be punctual . if you miss the bus , you will have to get there by your self .
how about the accommodation ?
the reception personnel will assist you in making room lists .
in case of any change of rooms or particular requests about accommodation , you are requested to contact our reception personnel .
do we have any privileges at the hotel ?
the hotel offers a variety of free services and entertainment for the participants .
and the individual sports committees provide free laundry for sportswear for training and competition purposes .
that &apos;s wonderful .
and the organizing committee will provide food for all participants .
refreshments are available before or after competition depending on the time of events .
oh , that &apos;s great .
besides that , i want to remind you of that you are requested to display your id cards during the games to ensure everything runs smoothly .
i hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
thank you .
say , what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
generally speaking , i like all sports and games , such as running , swimming , playing balls and so on .
what about you ?
i like team sports , basket ball , football and the like .
i never miss nba every year .
what do you mean by saying you &quot; never miss nba &quot; ?
of course i watch the on tv .
hi , john , do you practice taijiquan ?
a little . every morning i practice it .
great . i &apos;m now learning to do qigong or breathing exercises .
it &apos;s fascinating .
well , i feel that in doing either , we have to be very attentive .
the exercises demand great concentration of mind .
exactly .
perhaps that &apos;s the reason why it helps promote our health .
besides , the exercises have strict rules concerning postures and body positions . it &apos;s so hard to learn them by heart .
each form needs one posture and position , and it changes on every form .
can you practice the whole set now ?
well , i can only do the simplified version of taijiquan at the moment . i hope some day soon i can do the original .
chen , would you mind answering some questions about taijiquan ?
not at all .
please feel free to ask me anything concerning taijiquan .
how do you feel after doing it for so long ?
i &apos;m now in better health .
can i get a feel for the discipline if i try a few very rudimentary movements ?
sure .
there are a hundred or so different postures with wonderful names like &quot; white crane spreads its wings &quot; , &quot; needle at sea bottom &quot; , &quot; wave hands like a cloud &quot; , which give an idea of what you are expected to do , but you don &apos;t have to learn them all .
what should i learn first ?
the first series involve several basic steps .
now , start out standing erect with both hands at your sides .
relax yourself .
your heels should be lightly touching as you sink slightly at the knee and then separate your feet to shoulder width by gently moving one foot . straight up gradually . your feet should now be shoulder-width apart .
like this ?
yes .
just follow me .
repeat the movement , turning this time to the left .
i &apos;ve just seen a marvelous kung-fu movie .
i was deeply impressed by the chinese martial arts in it .
yes , chinese kung-fu is well-known throughout the world .
chen , every time i visit people &apos;s park , i find some old people doing relaxed , smooth and graceful form of exercises .
that &apos;s taijiquan .
it is suitable for people of all ages and physical conditions .
you can &apos;t help but notice its enormous following when you go out for a walk , especially during the early morning .
then this chinese discipline is used as a physical fitness programmed . it doesn &apos;t seem like a form of boxing .
the discipline is actually a soft or internal form of chinese boxing or kung-fu .
is there any relationship between taijiquan and qigong ?
yes .
qigong is the generic range of breathing exercises . they all focus on quiet concentration .
coordination is also important .
is it difficult to learn to perform taijiquan ?
it is not so complex as it was .
as more and more people are taking up taijiquan as a form of exercise , the state physical culture and sports commission has had taijiquan simplified to meet the demands of ordinary people .
what kind of qigong do you practice ?
well , i practice xiang gong .
what is xiang gong ?
xiang gong literally means &quot; fragrant qigong &quot; . it was made public in 1988 by an expert practitioner in luoyang , henan province .
tian ruisheng has popularized it throughout the country .
then why is it called xiang gong then ?
it is so named because it &apos;s said good practice of it can produce a fragrant smell from the body of the person .
have you smelled it yet ?
not yet .
but it doesn &apos;t matter .
i think what matters is that every day i can set aside a certain period of concentrating and thinking about nothing else at all .
that , i think , is very helpful .
is that qigong classified ?
yes , like other qigong exercises xiang gong is divided into three stages , that is a primary stage , an intermediate stage and a senior state .
is it hard to get into it ?
no , unlike other qigong exercises , it &apos;s very easy to start . you can start practice anywhere and anytime .
kenneth , what &apos;ll be the venue for sailing at athens 2004 ?
i don &apos;t know .
at the 27th olympics , the rushcutters bay of sydney was selected as the venue for the sailing competition .
do you think sailing interesting ?
to me , it is more interesting and exciting than any other sports .
i was engaged in sailing in my teens and i once represented my city in some competitions .
really ?
i &apos;ve never heard you mention that experience .
i think you were a very good sailor , and used to score high .
if i had been good , i wouldn &apos;t have scored high .
the scoring system for sailing is quite different from other sports .
in general , scores are awarded as points based upon the boats finishing position in each race .
the winner of each race scores one point , second place get two points , third place three points , etc .
those that did not finish scored points equal to one more than the number of boats that had gone through the event .
you mean the fewer points you get , the better racer you are ?
yes .
how many classes of boats were included in the olympics ?
on most occasions there are nine .
the accurate number of classes at sydney is eleven .
how are the boats categorized ?
different classes of boats are of different length , width , weight , and even their sails are of different areas .
take length for example . 470 class is 4.7 meters , finn class is 4.5 meters , tornado class is 6.09 meters , laser class is 4.23 meters , star class is 6.92 meters , soling class is 8.15 meters , europe class is 3.35 meters , mistral is 3.72 meters , and 49er class is 4.99 meters .
you are so great to tell those numbers at a stretch .
besides i wonder what are the basic skills required of the sailing competitors .
sailing requires endurance and strength .
and a sailor must also excel in boat-handling and competing tactics . he should be able to figure out at which angle to sail and on which tack in order to sail the shortest distance in the strongest wind .
of course , he must obey the race rules and try to avoid committing such fouls as hitting the yachting mark .
what should the racer do if he has hit a yachting mark ?
he &apos;ll have to circle the mark for 360 ° more before he can set himself free .
what if he commits a foul of false start ?
he &apos;ll have to come back behind the starting line to begin his sail again .
it &apos;ll be a loss to the competitor .
i &apos;d really want to pick sailing up as a hobby .
can you give me some instructions ?
i &apos;d love to .
john , you look so strong .
how i envy you !
i think you &apos;ve heard the saying : &quot; a sound mind dwells in a sound body . &quot;
i have always tried my best to keep fit for both my study and work .
right you are !
can you give me some tips as to how to keep fit ?
to my mind , the best way to keep fit is to go in for sports .
what kind of sports do you participate in ?
i go swimming once a week .
i do this even in cold winter .
i used to swim in high school , but i don &apos;t have time anymore .
that &apos;s too bad .
exercise is really important for your health .
i know .
i &apos;m getting a little fat .
i am short of breath when going upstairs .
that &apos;s a bad sign .
i think you need more exercises .
well , i &apos;m going swimming tonight .
do you want to go with me ?
okay .
i really need to get in shape again .
good morning , bob .
where are you bound ?
oh , it &apos;s you , tom .
i &apos;m off for a dip in the bay .
won &apos;t you come along ?
i only wish i could .
i should like nothing better .
but i have an engagement at nine this morning , and must be on hand sharp on time .
i &apos;m sorry you cannot come .
you swim , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m learning , but i am not very expert in the water yet .
do you go in often ?
i used to take a cold plunge every morning , but recently i have not been up to it .
still , i am very fond of an early morning bath .
it sets up the circulation for the day .
sorry , i can &apos;t stop mort than a moment . bye !
bye !
i hope we &apos;ll be able to swim somewhere .
how about to the swimming pool at the central gymnasium ?
that &apos;s boring .
i went there last saturday .
i think you should go to a swimmers &apos; pool .
oh , we are planning to the seaside next weekend . why not join us ?
will we be able to swim when we get there ?
yes . i think so .
but you have no diving tower or springboard or any lane there .
now , you !
how about the tide there ?
the tide will be out , it &apos;ll be safe any where .
for you won &apos;t be able to dive off the rocks . just when the tide is in , you &apos;ll be able to dive .
that &apos;s all right . i like diving but i prefer swimming .
when is high tide ?
low tide was at about nine o &apos;clock in the morning .
so high tide will be at about four the next afternoon .
can you swim ?
yes , i can swim a little .
are you fond of it ?
yes . i like it very much .
you are a fine swimmer , i presume .
no , i &apos;m a very poor swimmer , i can swim in a swim pool but i don &apos;t think i can do so in the sea .
if you can swim in the swim pool , you can then swim in the sea more easily .
why ?
because the sea water is more buoyant than fresh water as it contains salt , you know .
yes , but i dare not to try .
it is rather hot shall we take a cold bathe in the sea ?
all right . i will go to bathe with you .
do you want to race ?
oh , i know you &apos;re a lot faster than me , john .
what are you so afraid of ?
i don &apos;t how to swim , john .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t realize that .
i thought everyone knew how to swim .
no one ever taught me , so i never learned .
old huang , linlin is excellent .
this time he &apos;s sure to get a chance to medal .
i hope so .
since he finished fourth in the atlanta olympics , only 0.07 second slower than the third , linlin has trained even harder .
he has a great mind to get a medal .
old huang , during the 70 &apos;s , you were the most outstanding swimmer in china .
now your son has inherited your fame and has made himself the brightest star in swimming .
he has lived up to the country &apos;s and my expectations .
he wins the medal for his country and his people .
old huang has begun to train huang lin to swim since his childhood .
old huang can be called linlin &apos;s first teacher in swimming .
when linlin was only 5 years old , i found he &apos;s talented in swimming .
actually he has very good water feelings .
i worked out a plan for him and led him to understand not only the sense of touch in water but also the sense of b : resistance of body and the sense of body position in the process of progression though water .
he &apos;s quite sensitive .
old huang was very strict with linlin .
sometimes there was no eating or sleeping until linlin had got the hang of techniques .
without old huang , linlin couldn &apos;t have been an early bloomer .
without the rigorous training , his own constant effort and , above all his coaches in the national swimming team , linlin couldn &apos;t have made such a big progress and got a chance to medal .
hey , jane , where are you going this weekend ?
hi , bob , i &apos;m going to the beach with some friends .
do you want to come , too ?
yeah , that sounds like fun .
which beach are you going to ?
we were thinking about driving to the north to grover &apos;s beach .
i like to watch the sea birds there .
that sounds great !
when do you plan to leave ?
i think at about four o &apos;clock on friday .
do you have space for me in one of the cars ?
sure , we &apos;ll fit you into a car .
great .
where should we meet ?
meet me on friday in front of my house .
ok , i &apos;ll see you then . bye .
what kind of sports do you participate in ?
i go swimming once a week .
i do this even in cold winter .
i used to swim in high school , but i don &apos;t have time anymore .
that &apos;s too bad .
exercise is really important for your health .
i know .
i &apos;m getting a little fat .
i am short of breath when going upstairs .
that &apos;s a bad sigh .
i think you need more exercises .
well , i &apos; m going swimming tonight .
do you want to go with me ?
okay .
i really need to get in shape again .
congratulations on your winning the 200-metre freestyle .
thank you very much . i &apos;m very happy , especially because i didn &apos;t expect to achieve such a good result .
as a dark horse , what &apos;s your idea during your contest ?
in the pool , i tried to feel as if i was just fighting against myself , as if didn &apos;t have any opponents .
you set a milestone for chinese swimmers in the middle distance swimming to be ranked the world top level .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to attribute my victory to my excellent coach and his scientific training method and my efforts .
how did your training go before you came to this championship ?
i believe in my potential after a year with the national team . and i had altogether swum a total distance of 3200 kilometers this year .
so the record was not a surprise , because you knew that you had the ability to win .
not really . but i will try my best .
do you want to race ?
oh , i know you &apos;re a lot faster than me , john .
what are you so afraid of ?
i don &apos;t know how to swim , john .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t realize that .
i thought everyone knew how to swim .
no one ever taught me , so i never learned .
it &apos;s hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
let &apos;s bring our trunks and towels .
would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ?
i &apos;d prefer the pool .
ok .
let &apos;s pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room .
what style do you use ?
well , i use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun .
when watching swimming races , i find the fastest is most likely to be the one who is assigned the no.4 or no.5 lane .
i suppose you &apos;re watching semifinals or finals .
actually such arrangement follows one principle called &quot; spearhead . &quot;
what is it ?
as in the olympic final , according to the results of preliminary races , the fastest is assigned to the fourth lane , the second fastest to the fifth lane , the third to the third lane , the fourth to the six lane , etc .
if the entry times are a true indication of their abilities , the racers will fan out into the shape of a spearhead during the race .
it &apos;s a spectacle .
but sometimes dark horses do break the shape .
what swimming events are included in the olympic ?
32 at sydney . they consist of freestyle , backstroke , breaststroke , butterfly , individual medley and relay .
what do you mean by individual medley ?
it &apos;s a race in which competitors swim equal distances in each of the four basic strokes .
and the four strokes should be in this order : first butterfly , secondly backstroke , then breaststroke , and finally freestyle .
are there any rules that stipulate the order of relay ?
yes .
the order of relay is backstroke , breaststroke , butterfly , and freestyle .
which do you think is the fastest ?
the front crawl , i suppose . that &apos;s the stroke required of freestyle .
in freestyle , each arm is alternately brought over the top and then plunges into the water in front of the swimmer . at the same time , the legs perform a rapid kicking action .
what &apos;s the length of a lane ?
50 meters .
in races longer than that , racers have to turn when they have reached the end of it .
how does the judge know whether or not the racers have actually reached the end .
both ends of the lane are equipped with an electronic touch pad . it can automatically record and display the touch , which saves the judge a lot of trouble .
hi-tech is incredible . how do the racers turn ?
most swimmers take the tumble turn , for it is the fastest turn .
but in the races of butterfly and breaststroke , they can &apos;t turn until both hands have simultaneously touched the wall of the pool , so they take a spin turn .
next time i watch the swimming race , i &apos;ll pay some attention to such details .
look , ian thorpe stands up and waves to the audience .
he looks very confident .
he should be . he is the olympic and world record holder in the 400 meters freestyle .
at sydney 2000 , he covered 400 meters in 3 : 40.59 .
and he is the winner in the heats . so he is assigned the fourth lane .
what did the starter say ?
&quot; start your marks . &quot;
the competitors grasp the front edge of the platform . it &apos;s called a grab start .
there goes the gunshot .
the swimmer in the second lane jumps the shot .
maybe he is too nervous .
tom in the fifth line is leading .
come on , ian .
great !
ian catches up and overtakes tom .
ian is about to turn .
look at the screen . the underwater camera aims at his turning .
that &apos;s a flip turn , the fastest turn .
tom catches up . now he is even with ian .
yes , he is neck to neck with ian .
only 10 meters now .
come on , tom .
they almost touch the wall simultaneously .
tom clocks 48.01 , 0.01 faster than ian .
great .
you are great , tom . you beat the record holder .
i hope we &apos;ll be able to swim somewhere .
how about going to the swimming pool at the beijing gymnasium ?
that &apos;s boring .
i went there last saturday .
i think you should go to a swimmers &apos; pool .
oh , we are planning to the seaside next weekend . why not join us ?
shall we be able to swim when we get there ?
yes , i think so .
but you have no diving tower or springboard or any lane there .
now , you !
how about the tide there ?
the tide will be out , it &apos;ll be safe anywhere .
for you won &apos;t be able to dive off the rocks .
just when the tide is in , you &apos;ll be able to dive .
that &apos;s all right . i like diving but i prefer swimming .
when is high tide ?
low tide was at about nine o &apos;clock in the morning , so high tide will be at about four the next afternoon .
does your girlfriend like swimming ?
yes , she does .
she is good at backstroke and free style .
then you can help her with breaststroke and sidestroke .
but she wants to learn butterfly stroke .
really ?
then just ask her to follow me .
i heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
but i still have some difficulties in breathing .
say , kid , keep on practicing , you &apos;re sure to be a first-class swimmer .
to tell you the truth , i have never though of being a swimmer . i swim just for fun .
hi , tom , do you like swimming ?
yes .
what about you bill ?
i do , too .
do you usually swim in a river or a lake ?
i often swim in a river .
the water there is very clean and fresh .
you &apos;re fight . what styles do you use ?
i like the butterfly stoke .
and you ?
i prefer the breaststroke , though i can also do the sidestroke .
i still remember how i learned to swim at the very beginning .
it was so terrible . i choked several times on water .
can you tread water ?
no , i am sorry i can &apos;t .
well , don &apos;t be so upset .
you will , if you practice a lot .
actually i practiced for a long time before i could .
thank you for your encouragement .
what do you often do after school in summer ?
we often go swimming .
do you swim in a swimming-pool ?
no . there is no swimming-pool in our town . we go swimming in the river .
who taught you to swim ?
no one . i learned it by myself .
really !
how clever you are !
can you swim ?
yes .
let &apos;s go swimming this afternoon . ok ?
ok !
kate , did you watch some of the rowing events yesterday ?
no , bill .
i was too busy yesterday .
besides , i knew little about it .
i watched the final of men &apos;s quadruple sculls . it was wonderful .
which team won the gold medal ?
the italian team did .
they cooperated very well .
their team work was the key to their success .
i guess they must be very strong .
they are .
simone raineri impressed me most .
he demonstrated unusual strength and skills .
his stroke is smooth , leg drive powerful recovery fast .
how fast did they scull ?
i think more than 45 strokes a minute .
can the rate of striking be that high ?
yes .
i guess it might have reached 47 or 48 strokes in the sprint .
sprint ?
that &apos;s the last 500 meters of the race .
it is the point that everyone will try their best .
whoever has the guts to go even faster sins .
did the scull have a cox ?
no . it &apos;s coxless .
you know so much about rowing . it seems as if you are a rowing fan .
but i &apos;ve never rowed a boat yet .
it &apos;s chen wei &apos;s turn .
check what he chooses .
a forward four and a half somersaults with the degree of difficulty , 3.5 .
this is the death dive .
a former soviet diver died attempting it in an international competition .
he slammed his head into the tower on the second somersault , fracturing his skull .
how terrible !
chen wei poises himself at the top of the platform .
his leg muscle tense and he rises on his toes .
he pushes himself away from the tower .
he begins to spin .
once , twice three times , four times , plus one more half .
he rips the surface of the pool .
yeah !
small splash .
perfect !
really terrific !
he averages a score of 8.9 from each judge .
and his total score is 691.7 .
chen wei has the gold medal in the bag .
douglas is stepping up the tower .
he &apos;s going to go his seventh dive , the forward one and a half somersaults with half twist .
the degree of difficulty is 2.0 .
great .
small splash .
his score is 69.5 .
his total score is 472.3 .
gao min has won a second title at the barcelona olympic games .
it &apos;s a piece of cake for her to win a title .
as far as i know , she has never lost in any major world tournaments , including the world cup , world championships and the olympics since her victory at the 1986 world championships in madrid .
but she was lagging behind in the third place after preliminaries in the final she stayed behind russian irina lashko until the seventh dive .
why was she lagging behind in the preliminaries ?
gao min is famous for her hard training .
she said she had injuries to both shoulders and her waist for a long time .
the injuries were the result of hard training and competition and she said she had been receiving medical treatment continually since coming to barcelona .
i see .
it &apos;s not easy to be a sports woman .
i heard that gao min wanted to retire right after 1990 beijing asian games .
that was true . but people encouraged her to keep on . this time she may retire .
what &apos;s she going to do then ?
she said she needed at least one year before deciding what she is going to do next .
kaiming , here is great news for you . china won another gold medal of diving today .
who was it and for what event ?
tian liang won the gold medal of men &apos;s platform .
how many medals have china won in diving alone ?
ten-five golds and five silvers .
it &apos;s safe to say china is a dominant country in diving .
you see i know very little about diving .
i am busy with my work all day and have no time to watch the live broadcast .
a free-lance writer , you are so lucky .
can you tell me how many diving events there are at the olympic ?
four for men and women each-springboard , synchronized springboard , platform , synchronized platform .
are synchronized events newly added to sydney 2000 ?
yes .
synchronized diving is unique because it features two divers as a team .
the two divers of a team perform either on the 3-meter springboard or 10-meter platform using the same , or similar , dives .
3-meter springboard and 10-meter platform were the only two diving events represented at the past olympics .
what &apos;s the depth of the diving pool ?
6 meters .
how many dives does a racer have to take in an event ?
in the springboard event , take 11 dives , and women take 10 dives .
in the platform event , men take 10 dives , and women take 8 dives .
they consist of some required dives and some optional dives .
for example , the men &apos;s springboard consist of 5 required dives and 6 optional dives .
what are the required dives ?
a forward dive , a backward dive , a reverse dive , an inward dive , and a forward dive with a half twist .
these dives may be performed straight , piked or with tuck .
i &apos;ve heard of the degree of difficulty . what &apos;s its range ?
it ranges from 1.2 for a simple forward dive to 3.5 for a highly difficult forward four and a half somersault dive .
what positions can divers take during the execution of the dive ?
the basic positions they can take are straight position , free position , pike or tuck .
fu mingxia impressed me most with her wonderful and perfect entry .
how did she achieved it ?
the key was her painstaking practice coupled with some skills .
she lands on the palms of the hands and opens the water with them . also , she performs a breaststroke motion with her arms under water , so creating pockets of air on either side of her body .
this effect leaves only foam on the surface of the water . there is no splash .
tomorrow i &apos;ll be free . i can watch the olympics all day .
are there diving events tomorrow ?
the diving competitions have come to an end .
gao min has won a second title at the barcelona olympic games .
it &apos;s a piece of cake for her to win a title .
as far as i know , she has never lost in any major world tournaments , including the world cup , world championships and the olympics since her victory at the 1986 world championships in madrid .
but she was lagging behind in the third place after preliminaries . in the final she stayed behind russian irina lashko until the seventh dive .
why was she lagging behind in the preliminaries ?
gao min is famous for her hard training .

the injuries were the result of hard training and competitor and she said she had been receiving medical treatment continually since coming to barcelona .
i see .

that was true . but people encouraged her to keep on . this time she may retire .
what &apos;s she going to do then ?
she said she needed at least one year before deciding what she is going to do next .
and there is bad news for another chinese diver , tan liangde .
what has happened ?
for the rest of his life , he could be known as the silver-medal-man .
he failed in his third olympic effort to win the gold medal in men &apos;s springboard here in barcelona .
get up , lazybone !
the 100-meter race is going to be broadcast live in a minute .
oh , really ?
i &apos;m up now .
you don &apos;t wash your face ?
no .
100-meter race is my favorite .
it makes me goofy .
this is really a terrific summer .
i can finish watching all the events before the university opens .
you watch the olympics by day and sit by the computer by night .
you really enjoy your holidays .

it &apos;s an off day .
where &apos; s day and mum ?

you look pale .
i failed in the preliminary for the 100-meter-dash .
i was rather disappointed at my performance yesterday .
i am sorry to hear that .
i am very disappointed at not getting a chance to compete in the final .
what a pity .
but , you still have your 200-meter race .
it is a bad beginning .
but i hope that i can perform well in the next event .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll do better next time , i &apos;m sure .
hi !
hi !
what event are you in ?
decathlon .
may i ask you a few questions ?
yes , please .
could you tell me what &apos;s the difference between track and field ?
athletic events are divided into two broad categories . track and field .
each has its particular events .
can you make it more specific ?
ok .
events on the track can be divided into several sections .
on the flat , there are sprints , middle distance races and long distance races .
there are also the 4 × 100m relay and the 4 × 400m relay .
in addition , races are run over hurdles and barriers from 110 meters up to 3000 meters .
extreme distance races include the marathon over 42 kilometers and the men &apos;s 50 kilometers road walk .
what about the events in the field ?
events in the field can be divided into two sections ; jumping and throwing .
jumping events include the high jump , long jump , triple jump and pole vault .
throwing events comprise the javelin , discus , hammer and shot put .
i see .
the women &apos;s 100m race is to be broadcast live right away .
really ?
i won &apos;t miss it for anything . it makes me goofy .
what a terrific summer ! i can finish watching all the olympic events before returning back to school .
hurry !
the sprinters are in their lanes now . they are doing up some warming-up exercises .
the race must be tense and close , i suppose .
we get gail devers , women &apos;s 100m champion of the 26th olympic games and the defending champion this time , and .
listen , gail is in the third lane .
who &apos;s that woman in the fifth lane ?
marion jones .
i thought you knew all of them .
not everyone .
is she an australian ?
no . she is an american .
what was the performance of gail at atlanta ?
10.94 seconds .
i know nothing about marion . she looks calm .
but i guess she can &apos;t rival gail .
you know , gail is very good at acceleration after 20 meters .
however , you must be aware of the fact that few can be a consecutive champion at olympics .
what &apos;s the world record of the women &apos;s 100 meters ?
10.49 seconds .
griffith joyner set it at indianapolis in 1988 .
i remember she was a 1988 seoul gold medal winner , wasn &apos;t she ?
that &apos;s right .
but he didn &apos;t break the world record she made although she set an olympic record of 10.62 seconds .
look .
the final is on the line .
the starter calls the runners stand behind their blocks .
they are to rise to the set position .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh , nothing .
just nervous .
you seem to be more nervous and excited than the sprinters .
it fires .
great !
gail takes the lead .
but marion catches up . overtakes gale . hits the line .
marion ran a perfect race .
terrific !
oh , 10.75 seconds .
incredible ! marion is something .
hurry up , the clerk of the course is calling the roll .
my god !
where &apos;s my number ?
well , it &apos;s in my jacket .
wear it on your chest .
don &apos;t be nervous . mind your start and don &apos;t beat the gun again this time .
i will .
according to the workout , we are going to practise on 100m dash in this class . and we will begin with start techniques .
what kind of start are we going to practise ?
crouching start or elongated start .
the elongated one .
shall we use blocks ?
no , as a beginner , you needn &apos;t start from blocks .
what &apos;s the program for men &apos;s 800m ?
the heats will be at 9 : 00 monday morning . the semi-finals will be at 16 : 00 wednesday afternoon and the finals will be at 14 : 00 sunday afternoon .
it &apos;s the last lap . tome and jack are still running abreast .
they are coming off the home curve .
look . tome has sped up .
he &apos;s sprinting at his top speed .
jack is speeding up , too . i am sure he has won the match .
i don &apos;t think so . they breast the tape at the same time .
the electric photo-timer will tell .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you look pale .
i failed in the preliminary for the 100 - meter-dash .
i was rather disappointed at my performance yesterday .
i am sorry to hear that .
i am very disappointed at not getting a chance to compete in the final .
what a pity .
but , you still have your 200-meter race .
it is a bad beginning .
but i hope that i can perform well the nest event .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll do better next time , i &apos;m sure .
hello , mary .
fancy meeting you again !
hello , jane .
haven &apos; t seen you for a long time .
i suppose you are here for field events ?
no . i &apos;ll take part in the 100-metre low hurdle .
that &apos;s in track events .
oh , my !
what a bad memory .
you won the dash race last year .
you still compete in long-distance race ?
no . this time i &apos;ll try marathon .
that &apos;s a great challenge .
i hear your boyfriend is also here ?
yes . he is just over there , the one in blue .
oh , so tall and so strong !
and he is intelligent , too .
intelligent ?
what do you mean ?
well , he can speak five languages .
can he ?
what languages can he speak ?
he can speak french , spanish , italian , german , and japanese .
oh ! so great .
is he a high jumper ?
no . he is a discus thrower .
then mind that he throws you out sometime .
he dares not !
now , is there anything new today ?
yes . the world women &apos;s 5 000 meters record is broken .
who broke it ?
i don &apos;t know her name .
but she is a new one and the time was much faster .
by how many seconds did she break the mark ?
she clocked 14 : 28.09 .
oh , i remember the listed world record is 14 : 36.45 held by a portuguese .
yes . she &apos;s much faster than the portuguese .
i &apos;m sure if with exercises of a systematic and scientific training method , she will win the next olympics .
you &apos;re quite right .
good morning , bob . you &apos;re an early bird .
good morning , john . you &apos;re also early . people often say that morning is the best time of a day for physical exercises .
yes . i &apos;ve been in the habit of getting up early and taking exercises in the morning .
oh , the spring track and field meet will be held a month from now. have you entered for any events ?
yes , broad jump and disc throwing . i &apos;m good at them .
the school records of these two games were set up by me last year . i hope i can break them this time .
what about you ? i know you &apos;re good at running .
yes , i like running . i &apos;ve signed up for 100-meter dash and 800-meter race .
i have planned to take part in the 5,000-meter long-distance run as i have good endurance , you know .
but there &apos;s a limit to the number of games one can sign up for , so i have to give it up .
what a pity , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll win honors for your class in the above games as well .
i &apos;m not so sure myself .
my records of these games have never been very good .
what &apos;s more , i haven &apos;t done enough practice for them .
but i think if we practice hard in the following few weeks , we can expect to do better .
thank you for your encouragement .
no matter what the results will be , i &apos;ll do my best .
by the way , aren &apos;t you on your class tug-of-war team ?
no , not really .
why ?
you see , i was asked to be the cheer leader .
oh , it &apos;s also very important .
nobody can do better than you at this .
thank you .
i watched a high jump event last night , there are some parts i don &apos;t understand .
what are they ?
if two athletes both make the same height , but failed in the next one , who will be the winner ?
it will depend on who had fewer misses on that height .
what if it is still the same ?
look at the last one . if it &apos;s still the same , keep going .
what if they are all the same ?
well , this doesn &apos;t happen frequently .
what if it really happens ?
they &apos;ll have an extra game , if it is still the same , one more , till the tie is broken .
are you going to take part in the coming sports meet ?
yes , i am .
which events have you entered ?
the high jump .
i &apos;ve been training for it .
good .
i &apos;ll hurl the javelin .
as a matter of fact , the long jump is the competition between lewis and holmon . both of them are american .
only one will be the champion .
now holmon begins his first try .
take . 8.13 meters .
he doesn &apos;t control his rhythm properly .
lewis is preparing for his first try .
he looks very confident .
his approach run is very fast .
he accelerates gradually fast .
8.26 meters .
a good beginning .
the first try is over .
lewis &apos;s in the first place and holmon &apos;s in the fourth .
you see , holman and lewis are both blacks .
and many sprinters are blacks .
why ?
blacks have a different skeletal structure in the ankle and foot .
and their heel strings are longer .

i &apos;ve decided to join the victor boxing association . can you take the trouble to write me a letter of recommendation ?
that &apos;s my pleasure .
what a powerful left hook !
it almost sends lewis down to one knee .
martin &apos;s really courageous .
he charges lewis instead of fighting timidly , weaving and dunking .
martin &apos;s left hook deserves its fame .
but he has used too many swings , which has given chances to lewis .
martin &apos;s swing mispunches .
lewis punches martin on the head .
a combination of left , right .
martin crashes into the rope .
john hogg raises lewis &apos; arm high , lewis wears the belt .
his coach is hugging him .
one of lewis &apos;s entourage applies an ice pack to a mouse over his left eye .
olympic wrestling champion pirim of turkey was banned for four years after testing positive early this year .
who decided the punishment on him ?
fila , the federation internationale de luttes amateurs .
when was the urine sample collected ?
just after pirim participated in the european championship in istanbul last spring .
how did pirim perform in the barcelona olympics ?
great !
he won in the 62 kilogram class .
has pirim accepted the accusation ?
no , he denied it .
how about this weekend &apos;s world greco-roman wrestling championships in stockholm ?
he was replaced by another player .
do you like watching wrestling , val ?
no .
why ?
but i think it &apos;s interesting .
interesting as it is , it doesn &apos;t last long enough to maintain my interest .
it &apos;s coming to an end the moment my interest has just aroused .
i wonder why the international wrestling association didn &apos;t prolong it to 30 minutes or more a bout .
i feel just the same as you .
but yesterday evening the greco-roman final between mr.sim kwon-ho and mr.rivas was very wonderful , indeed .
of what weight category were they ?
54 kilograms , that is , flyweight according to some categorization .
both the wrestlers were very flexible &apos; and quick in attacking .
they displayed excellent skills in holding , throwing , tripping , and pinning .
at the end of the second round , they got the same score , so an extra round was done to decide the winner .
who won the gold medal ?
mr.sim kwon-ho from south korea .
but for a slight foul on the part of mr.rivas , it would have been a tough job for the referee to judge who should be the winner .
what constitutes a foul in wrestling besides punching ?
also , kicking and pulling vulnerable parts of the opponent &apos;s body will be penalized .
nicolas , i &apos;ll have to go now , for i1l be watching an equestrian race at nine o &apos;clock .
see you tomorrow .
it is interesting that wrestling is an olympic sport .
why do you say so ?
you know when i was young , i always liked wrestling with my brother or sister , but in the end i was usually defeated .
how many you are !
why were you defeated ?
because i always laughed during the games .
i see now .
so when you the wrestling match in the olympics , you &apos;ll easily think of your childhood , right ?
you are quite right .
but we children usually wrestled on the bed , but the wrestlers did on a large mat .
i can imagine how happy and interesting your childhood was .
by the way , did you have a referee ?
of course .
when i was wrestling with my sister , then my brother was the referee .
so everyone could be a referee ?
yes .
and our referee usually cried out : &quot; come on ! come on ! &quot;
ha , ha .
i think it is hard for the referee to be responsible for controlling the bout .
yes .
the referee should concentrate his efforts to watch the wrestlers carefully .
what constitute a foul in wrestling ?
fouls include kicking , punching and puling vulnerable parts of the opponent &apos;s body .
what are the penalties for committing a foul ?
for committing a foul , a wrestler is penalized one point , or may even be disqualified .
really ?
what a shame if a wrestler is disqualified ?
yes , but it could not be helped .
well , can you tell me how long each round lasts ?
ok .
each round lasts three minutes .
why does it only last 3 minutes ?
how can i know ?
it &apos;s a rule of international competition .
maybe it is because one &apos;s strength is limited .
maybe .
i think it is hard for the referee to be responsible for controlling the bout .

where have you been recently , mason ?
i &apos;ve been learning judo .
is it difficult ?
the judo itself is not difficult to learn . but the terms for it are very hard .
you see , judo originated from japan , so judo terms are for the most part japanese words .
is your instructor a japanese ?
no . he is a chinese and he is a very good judoka .
if the japanese ranking system were applied to him , i believe he would rank among the seventh or the eighth dan .
is he ?
i hear judokas wear belts of different colors to show their technical rank .
yes .
for instance , judokas of the highest rank , that is , the tenth dan , wear a red belt .
which is more important in judo , strength or techniques ?
techniques .
the key to success is to employ good technique to throw the opponent down to the tatami , that is , the floor covered with mats , and hold him or her down .
if you can hold him down for 30 or more seconds , you &apos;ll score an ippon and win the competition .
ippon means one point .
if you can hold him or her down for 25-30 seconds , you &apos;ll get a waza-ari , two waza-aris equal an ippon .
for 20-25 seconds of holding down , you &apos;ll get a yuko .
if such case lasts only 10-20 , you &apos;ll get a koka .
these terms are really hard to understand .
by the way , if they break some rules , what will be the punishment ?
the punishment varies according to the degree of the foul .
the most common include note caution , warning and disqualification . the technical terms for them are shido , chui , keikoku , and hansokumake , respectively .
they sound very interesting .
virgil , it &apos;s the first time for me to watch a taekwondo competition .
can you tell me some basic rules about it ?
ok .
first you should know that taekwondo was derived from the ancient oriental martial arts , and courtesy is a very important tenet .
so the referee asks the competitors to bow to one another before each contest begins .
it &apos;s funny .
each bout is contested over three three-minute rounds with a minute &apos;s recess in between .
points are scored by landing punches and kicks .
punches and kicks ?
yes .
both hand and foot can be applied to attack and defense .
punches must be landed with the index and middle-finger knuckles of the fist .
when kicking , some part of the foot below the ankle must strike the opponent in a scoring area .
what are the scoring areas in taekwondo ?
the scoring areas are the head , the abdomen and each side of the body .
how is the winner decided ?
there are three ways of winning a contest , that is , by knocking out the opponent , by outscoring the opponent or by default .
what do you mean by &quot; by default &quot; ?
it occurs if the opponent incurs three-point penalties or is disqualified .
basically , taekwondo has two kinds of penalties-kyong-go and gam-jeom .
kyong-go means a warning or half-point deduction and gam-jeom means a one-point deduction .
i see . thank you .
you are welcome .
hi , tom !
when did you come back ?
yesterday .
i was really sorry to see it end .
the skating was terrific !
i am really jealous !
i won &apos;t be able to get any time off for at least another 3 or 4 months .
sorry to hear that !
but i would definitely recommend this place !
you would like it .
i hope that i &apos;ll have a chance to go skating there .
you can go there next month . it is the best season there .
excuse me , i &apos;d like to rent a pair of skis .
yes . what size , please ?
a pair of skis of 170cm long and a pair of 27cm boots please .
one moment , please .
ah , here you are .
thanks , how much is the deposit ?
＄ 100 please .
what time does this shop close ?
not until five .
excuse me , can i have a map of the slopes ?
sure , here it is .
where can i get on a ski lift ?
walk down this road , and you &apos;ll find the sigh there .
where can i buy a one-day ticket to the lift ?
do you give a holiday discount ?
the same place .
i &apos;m sorry there &apos;s no discount on holidays .
where is the locker for skiers ?
can i leave my baggage there ?
certainly . let me show you where it is .
thank you so much .
can we ski around here ?
yes , you can .
and it &apos;s the peak time now .
thanks .
is there a skiing slope with a nice view ?
oh , it &apos;s in the devil valley .
are there any slopes for beginners ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
how can i get there ?
you can take a train or a taxi there .
the tourist maps are on the shelves over there .
can i rent ski equipments there ?
don &apos;t worry about that .
there &apos;s a lot of equipment there for rent .
horse racing isn &apos;t just a sport - it &apos;s also a big business .
recently a derby winner was sold for fifteen million pounds , so a great deal of care and effort goes into training and looking after horses .
betsy , how would you describe your job ?
well , mainly we look after the horses , ride them out .
are you a stable girl ?
yes .
are you in charge of the horses ?
yes .
right .
do you mostly have flat racers or jumpers ?
being a small yard , we have dual - purpose horses that can win on the flat and win over jumps as well .
does that make the racing season longer ?
more or less all the year round , yes .
i see .
because when the flat season finishes , jumping &apos;s started , so that takes you through the winter .
how early do you have to get up in the morning ?
about six .
we come in ; we check the horses have eaten up ; you muck them out ; and then you get your tack on , and you take them out ; you bring them up to the downs , and you work them .
you take them back ; they get fed ; then you have your breakfast , and then you come out and do it all over again till you &apos;re finished .
and what about the day before a race ?
does a horse get a lot of exercise or . ?
well , it &apos;s gradually worked up .
they work with the trainer , so that he knows how much work to give a horse , and they gradually work up until the day before they race , until they &apos;re fit .
and what about the day after ?
oh , they stay in .
they just get led out for a short while .
and that &apos;s an easy day , an easy day for a couple of days .
david , at what age is a horse ready to race ?
he &apos;s ready to race when he &apos;s a two-year-old .
he would normally be bought at about eighteen months old .
he &apos;s then broken in , which means introducing him to tack - saddle , bridle , and eventually a rider on his back .
and once he &apos;s used to that , he then goes along with other two-year-olds till they get used to going together , and then they gradually do faster . faster and faster work until they &apos;re ready to be introduced to the race-course .
how do you monitor its progress ?
rally by eye , and through the boys that ride them .
they know -they get the feel of it .
they can tell if an animal is backward , and you can see by the way it works at home whether or not it &apos;s ready to run , or whether it needs a bit more time .
do you have a special feeding programme ?
yes . the horses are fed a basic diet of oats , nuts and a few extra vitamins .
what about the horses &apos; health ?
well , i check the horses in the morning and i also see them at night .
normally a horse will tell you itself whether it &apos;s well , just by looking at it .
is its coat well ?
has it got a bit of sparkle about it ?
is its eye bright ?
just natural things .
you can also look to see if the horse has eaten its food .
if it has , then it &apos;s probably healthy .
you would also check it for worms every now and again , check its teeth and that sort of thing .
or a horse might have minor cuts which can be dealt with by antiseptic lotions , powders , disinfectant sprays , etc .
do you become very close to the horse ?
yes , you have to be very close to them .
it &apos;s important to try and get to know them individually , so that you can get the best out of them .
the stable boys must become very attached to the horses too ?
yes , i think that &apos;s right .
i mean , obviously , if a boy is looking after a horse that is winning him races and he &apos;s a character or a friendly sort of a horse , then he &apos;s going to become attached to him .
all the horses get looked after equally , but there are bound to be favorites .
that &apos;s unavoidable .
they are concerned about the costs , which will eventually be passed on to dafa garments .
that &apos;s what compensation trade is all about , and i &apos;m fully aware of that .
the problem is that there is no other way out .
they suggest that we reduce the costs by buying second-hand machines here in the us .
they , like the new machines , can do all the tricks . but would cost you a great deal less .
that sounds like a fabulous idea .
but do you really mean that the second-hands are just as good as the new ones ?
let me explain .
the labor costs here have become so high that the us garments industry has long lost the edge over their competitors from developing countries .
i can imagine that .
to make the matter worse , the orders received by the garments industry have gone down a great deal because of the recent recession .
a colleague of mine told me that quite a few garments makers in the la area are considering closing down their factories because their machines have stayed idle already for months .
a couple of them are looking for prospective buyers of their machines .
i see what you mean .
but how old are those machines ?
some of them are old , but many others are quite new .
good .
thank you very much for the information and advice .
now , what shall we do next ?
although i believe the second-hands are just as good as the new ones , i think you should come to the states and take a look by yourself . we can inspect the machines together to make sure they satisfy your needs .
that &apos;s just what i was going to say .
i also suggest we negotiate the deal together with the factory owners , because it is in our mutual interests to get the best possible machines at the lowest possible prices .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
when do you think i should come ?
as soon as i have two or three offers .
i think that &apos;ll take a week or so .
then i &apos;ll call you again .
okay . and i feel i should start to apply for a visa right away .
right .
so would you send an invitation for me and mr. yang . my assistant , so that i can start the ball rolling ?
sure thing .
could you give me mr. yang &apos;s full name , date and place of birth ?
i think i already have yours .
right . mr. yang &apos;s first name is zhonghua .
zhonghua ?
sorry , could you spell it in full ?
sure .
z-h-o-g-h-u-a , zhonghua .
and the last name is y-a-n-g , yang .
born on september 18 , 1966in beijing .
thank you .
i &apos;ll instruct my secretary to telex an invitation to you right away .
thanks a lot .
exactly a week has passed . mr. bowen is calling mr. li again
mr. li , good news for you . i &apos;ve got three offers of second-hand garments machinery .
terrific .
when do you think we should fly over ?
as soon as you get the visas .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;ll take three or four more days .
it &apos;s fine .
so shall i expect your arrival early next week ?
i think so .
there will be an air china flight to los angeles next monday .
if everything goes well , i &apos;ll take that flight .
good .
give me a ring or fax when you finalize your time for departure .
i will .
well , thank you very much for calling .
goodbye .
bye .
mr. li and mr. yang have got their us visas .
xiao yang , as a precaution , i think we should have the latest prices of similar machines made by the leading textile machinery makers of the world .
so that we won &apos;t be ripped off during the negotiations .
right on .
so would you go to china textile machinery corp. and ask them for quotations of similar machines made by japanese , italian and british firms ?
sure .
i &apos;ll pay them a visit tomorrow morning .
also , book two tickets for air china &apos;s monday flight .
i &apos;ll do that fight away .
oh , hello . ted .
you &apos;re just the person i wanted to speak to .

i &apos;ll see you nest tuesday .
mr. ku , i hope i can have an opportunity to discuss some of the insurance questions with you , if you don &apos;t mind .
no , not a bit .
if you are free , let us talk shop now .
it &apos;s very nice of you .
first about cargo insurance .
cargo insurance is a major item of our business .
we attach great importance to transportation insurance on china &apos;s imports and exports .
insurance protection is available for different means of transportation such as marine , land , aviation as well as by post .
insurance clauses are drawn up to cater for different kinds of commodities such as general cargo , refrigerated cargo , oil in bulk , live animals and poultry , and other goods .
i see .
your insurance coverage is quite comprehensive .
how do you fix the premium rates ?
the premium rates are fixed on the basis of the past statistical loss figures .
in principle , the rates vary with different interests insured , and with different destinations and routes and carrying periods of insurance .
what about the international insurance market ?
are your rates in line with it ?
oh , yes . we always take into consideration the rate in the international market . this is an important factor with we can hardly ignore .
do you handle open cover ?
what i mean is if the insured party wished to make a long-term arrangement with the insurance company , say , for a year .
of course , we do .
that saves a large amount of labour and material , and lessens the insured party &apos;s burden .
right .
besides , the insured party gets more favourable rates .
well , in case of loss or damage , the insured party can receive payment locally in our city , presume .
the people &apos;s insurance company of china at present maintains about three hundred cargo surveying and claim settling agents in more than 90 countries and regions to conduct on-the-spot surveys .
there is one agent in your city . out of these agents a very large number are authorized to effect settlement locally .
tell me the procedure that a consignee should follow , when damage to the goods occurs at destination .
the consignee should apply immediately for survey to the surveying agent or the claim settling agent .
in case our company does not have a surveying agent or claim settling agent at the destination , a local competent surveyor may be applied to for survey .
i suppose an ordinary surveyor will do .
of course , he must be competent to perform the job .
the consignee should obtain from the carrier or port authorities a certificate of loss or damage and / or shortland memo , so that he can lodge a claim against the carrier or the party concerned , as the case may be .
if the carrier were to make an excuse and disallow the claim , then the consignee would be at a loss for settlement .
don &apos;t worry about that . when you lodge a claim against the carrier , you may present the claim with the necessary documents to our company .
if after the examination of the case we find the claim justifiable , we shall make payment to the consignee and get the right of subrogation . meanwhile we will take recourse against the party responsible , e. g. the carrier .
under such circumstances , we are assured of payment of the claim and may leave the insurance company to deal with the carrier .
yes , this is so , only when the third party liability is involved .
if the carrier is at fault , he will be held responsible for the loss or damage .
if it is due to the perils of sea or maritime accidents , the insurance company shall be liable to pay .
i suppose there are conditions under with the insurance company is not liable . is that right ?
yes . if the loss or damage to the goods is caused by the intentional act or fault of the insured , or arising from inherent vice or normal loss of the insured gods or delay in transit , or falling under the liability of the consignor , the insurance company is not liable to pay .
in the last instance , the buyer should file a claim against the seller .

right .
besides , the insured party gets more favourable rates .
well , in case of loss or damage , the insured party can receive payment locally in our city , i presume .
what &apos;s an economic risk ?
each minute of the day or night , everyone faces a possible financial loss .
a home may be destroyed by fire , damaged by lightning , or leveled by a tornado .
personal belongings may be stolen .
a car may be damaged in an accident , or it may cause injury to people and property .
income may be lost as the result of the death , disability , or unemployment of a family wage earner .
the chance that a loss of this kind may occur is called an economic risk .
can savings share economic risk ?
savings provide one way to take care of financial losses .
but savings are not the answer to large losses.the best way to guard against large financial losses is through insurance .
i see .
another thing i don &apos;t understand at this moment is the advantage of w.p.a. coverage .
i thought that the w.p.a. insurance should cover all principal risks whilst , according to what you say , it means very little .
it seems to be a phrase without much substance .
just what is the difference between wpa and fpa ?
this is a question which is very often overlooked , mr. vichers .
it is a very common but mistaken idea that a merchant has done everything that is required to protect himself against losses , when he has taken out w.p.a. insurance .
there is , perhaps , no mistake more detrimental to his interests .
that interests me very much .
i must confess that i was under the impression that w.p.a. insurance was quite sufficient and that losses due to breakage were covered .
i know that f.p.a.insurance does not cover losses on consumer goods , but i did think that the w.p.a.insurance covered more risks than the f.p.a.
mr. seige from australia has purchased a lot of crockery from jiangsu art &amp; craft import &amp; export company .
he is now talking with mr. tao , the head of insurance department of the company .
mr. tao , i &apos;d like to talk the insurance covering the consignment with you .
good . please go ahead .
are you going to have the consignment covered ?
yes .
we are going to insure the crockery with the picc .
the picc ?
oh , that is the abbreviation for the people &apos;s insurance company of china .
can you give me a brief introduction of the company ?
yes .
this company was founded in 1949 , which is famous for its sound credit and reasonable rate .
it has over 300 surveyors and agents in the main ports in the world .
that sounds very interesting .
the company can cover the all basic risks such as f.p.a. ; w.p.a. ; all risks and other additional risks .
the coverage is quite extensive .
here is the copy of the ocean marine cargo clauses of picc .
please have a glance at it .
thank you .
after a brief look at the copy
as to my shipment , i &apos;d like to have them covered against w.p.a. plus the risk of breakage .
these suit your consignment well .
i am afraid you have to pay the premium .
that &apos;s understood .
can you give me some ideas of the premium charged by the picc ?
sure .
the premium is calculated in this way .
first find out the premium rate for the crockery , that is 0.5 % ; secondly , consider the risk covered . what you have insured just now is w.p.a. and the risk of breakage . finally , calculate the total invoice value .
our usual practice is to insure the parcel for 110 % of the invoice value .
therefore your premium should be about .
can i insure the shipment for 130 % invoice value ?
we can arrange for that as requested .
however , the extra premium is for your account .
i &apos;ll surely do that .
if you have no more question , please fill in this application form .
ok .
insured : william seige
description of the shipment : 100c / s crockery , marked gh in diamond .
shipment : by s. s . &quot; helen &quot; , scheduled to sail from nanjing to sidney on 8 march , 1996 .
coverage : w.p.a. plus the risk of breakage
amount insured : for 130 % of the invoice value
is that all right , mr. tao ?
yes .
we &apos;ll have your consignment insured with the picc against w.p.a. and the risk of breakage for 130 % invoice value .
thank you very much for your help .
you are welcome .
do i understand that &quot; all marine risks &quot; means less than &quot; all risks &quot; ?
the english understand by &quot; marine risks &quot; only risks incident to transport by sea , such as collision , stranding , fire , penetration of sea water into the holds of the ships , etc. in other words , under &quot; all marine risks &quot; recoverable loss will only be confined to those arising from perils of the sea and maritime accidents only . the &quot; all risks &quot; coverage will admit all losses occurring at any time throughout the whole currency of the coverage , irrespective of whether they are caused by accidents at sea or on land . in this sense , &quot; all marine risks &quot; provides a more limited cover than &quot; all risks &quot; .
i see .
another thing i don &apos;t understand at this moment is the advantage of w. p. a. overage .
i thought that w.p.a. insurance should cover all principal risks while , according to what you say , it means very little .
it seems to be a phrase without much substance .
just what is the difference between w.p.a. and f.p.a. ?
this is a question which is very often overlooked , mr. vichers .
it is very common but mistake idea that a merchant has done everything that is required to protect himself against losses when he has taken out w.p.a. insurance .
there is , perhaps , no mistake more detrimental to his interests .
that interests me very much .
i must confess that i was under the impression that w.p.a. insurance was quite sufficient and that losses due to breakage were covered i know that f.p.a. insurance does not cover losses on consumer goods , but i did think that the w.p.a. insurance covered more risks than the f.p.a.
actually it is like this .
there is some difference between w.p.a. and f.p.a.
the f.p.a. clause does not cover partial loss of the nature of particular average , whereas the w.p.a. clause covers such losses when they exceed a prearranged percentage .
this is the only difference between w.p.a. and f. p.a.
otherwise , the protection under the f.p.a. clause will be almost identical with that offered by the w.p.a. clause , because in the event of maritime accidents encountered in transit , such as stranding , fire , explosion or collision , both clause will cover particular average losses in full .
i don &apos;t mean to annoy you , mr. ku , but i don &apos;t quite grasp this . couldn &apos;t you say it in simpler terms ?
i &apos;ll try .
neither the w.p.a. nor the f.p.a. mentions the risks covered or the risks excluded .
the extent of insurance is stipulated in the basic policy form and in the various risks clauses .
look at the insurance certificates and you will find that the risks of theft and pilferage , freshwater , oil , grease , hooks , breakage , leakage , contamination , deterioration , etc. are specifically mentioned and must be specifically applied for . these are special risks . f.p.a. stands for &quot; free from particular average . &quot;
mr. ku , i must say that you have corrected my ideas about the insurance .
i see now that this is far more complicated than i ever imagined .
now i know why you often point out to us the wording of some letters credit which you don &apos;t feel happy about .
but what are we to do about it ?
we must keep to the stipulations of the contract and the letter of credit .
the blame does not only rest with the letter of credit .
for an item like ceramics , i think the light industrial products corporation should have understood from our letter of credit that we wanted to cover all the risks , including the risk of breakage . i must say the error was on both sides and i think the loss ought to be shared by both parties , let us say half and half .
our price calculation could hardly admit that .
besides , we acted upon your instructions , so it is not our fault .
but in view of our good relationship , we &apos;ll supply you with a favourable offer to compensate some of your losses .
i sincerely hope that you gentlemen will settle the matter to our mutual satisfaction .
it goes without saying that both parties must abide by the contract terms which we have agreed upon and signed .
this blunder , which is due to my ignorance , has cost me a pretty penny .
we also have learned a lesson from this .
well , to compensate a part of the loss , as you suggested , may i ask you to make us a firm offer for 50 000 glazed wall tiles c. i.f. manila including the risk of breakage , november shipment ?
we &apos;ll make you an offer tomorrow . come and see us at 9 a.m.
thank you . tomorrow at 9 then .
what should we do when our shipment has been totally lost or partially damaged ?
we must prepare our claim and send it to the insurance company to secure payment .
do brokers take care of that ?
yes , they usually do .
in europe they charge a one percent commission on the amount of the claim for their collecting services while in the united states they do the work without charge to the importer .
that &apos;s part of the service on the broker &apos;s side .
exactly .
when we have bought insurance for the country of destination , we can directly contact the insurance company or through our brokers .
what are the documents needed to obtain payment ?
well let &apos;s talk about that next time .
mr. li and mr. bowen have signed the letter of intent for compensation trade and agreed to keep each other informed of any new development .
almost a month has passed since mr. bowen returned to the us .
mr. li is waiting for his response .
the telephone rings .
dafa garments .
can i help you ?
could i speak to mr. li , please ?
may i ask who &apos;s calling ?
richard bowen of will shire fashion , the united states .
mr. bowen !
how are you ? i &apos;m zhonghua yang .
hi mr. yang !

what !
i don &apos;t quite understand .

abc camera shop .
hello .
i bought a canon auto-focus camera from you last week , and now the shutter isn &apos;t working .
i see . can you describe the trouble in detail ? perhaps it &apos;s only a minor problem .
when i install the film and press the shutter release , nothing happens , i think it &apos;s broken .
i see .
if you bring the camera and the warranty card into our store , we &apos;ll be glad to repair it .
unfortunately i &apos;m here on a business trip and i &apos;m going to return to guangzhou tomorrow . can it be repaired there under the warranty ?

we &apos;ve just received a delivery of your tin plate this morning . but we found it had already begun to rust . it &apos;s unusable , so we would like to ask you for an explanation .
i see .
would you mind telling me the type , quantity , invoice number , and ship name ?
spte-t3-b , nine tons , invoice no. 1558 and the ship name was &quot; abc &quot; .
thank you . i &apos;ll have a representative of abc trading company visit you as soon as possible to investigate the problem .
has there been any important mail for me ?
no , sir , nothing that can &apos;t wait for your return.but there was call this morning from the london tomes .
it was mr. muller .
what did he have to say ?
he wanted to talk with you personally , so i gave him your home number .
well , the call hasn &apos;t come through , so i &apos;ll try go get him later .
oh , and before i forget , contact gregory burr and arrange a meeting for tomorrow afternoon .
yes , sir .
will that be all , sir ?
yes , thank you . good-bye .
i &apos;ve got some unpleasant news for you today .
what is it ?
you know the cargo to be shipped in this month ?
yes .
we are behind schedule , i &apos;m afraid .
behind ? for how long ?
five to seven days .
i think we can manage that .
thank goodness .
i &apos;m relieved to hear that .
after refilling his glass , mr. li has made acquaintance with a few more guests at the party .
then he sees mr. bowen walking towards him .
hi , mr. li , how are you doing ?
i &apos;m doing great .
and you ?
i &apos;ve also had a fantastic time tonight .
good to hear that .
well , it &apos;s a shame that i must be leaving .
really , it &apos;s only seven thirty .
i know , but i have a very important meeting tomorrow morning : to report to my board of directors on the compensation trade with you .
so you want to go to the meeting well prepared .
right .
before i leave , i want to say it &apos;s such a pleasure working with you , mr. li .
the pleasure is mine .
and the agreement we &apos;ve made is great .
i &apos;m sure the directors will be glad to hear that .
we &apos;ll do everything we can to carry it out .
so will we .
okay . take care and i hope to hear from you again soon .
you also take good care .
please give my regards to mrs bowen .
i will .
have a nice flight home .
how did you find that last lot of marmalade ?
oh , excellent .
but one or two buyers said the marmalade might be a little too sweet .
i see .
and the canned peaches , what about them ?
ah , that &apos;s a different story .
the taste of the peaches is fine ; but as you know , appearance counts in canned foods .
without any doubt , appearance comes before price .
how could the canned peaches be improved ?
i recommend a pleasant color and no mess .
where &apos;s the mess , exactly ?
in the syrup , or in the peach halves ?
customers have told me that hollow of the peach halves , you know , the inside of the peach , should be clean cut ; that is to say , no fibers or pulp remaining .
aren &apos;t they supplied that way now ?
no , many consignments are not .
are these goods needed urgently ?
not urgently .
we want to be able to release them in our market , say , three months from now .
then , i &apos;ll have a talk with one or two of our makers . they &apos;ll be in to see me sometime this week .
what else have you got outstanding besides these piece goods ?
the made-up goods for europe , and the rayon scarves for southeast asia .
well , the last lot of scarves , after we took the delivery , we heard of a competitor getting similar scarves from the same maker only at thirty dollars per dozen .
really ?
we &apos;ll look into that . might have been a question of quantity again .
anyway , we &apos;ll see what the makers have to say about this .
well , that &apos;s about all for the present .
we may have some more business for you before long . let &apos;s hear from you about market conditions from time to time .
certainly . i &apos;ll let you know what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;ve been a little behind schedule in sending us your supplies lately , we &apos;ve noticed .
yes , we have in one or two consignments , i &apos;m sorry to say .
shipping line schedules haven &apos;t fitted in very well .
we were three weeks late in getting our goods to the distributors .
how about sending two consignments a month , making them approximately half the value of the present monthly shipment we are sending you now ?
no , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any need to change the monthly arrangement .
it is easier for us to keep to the present monthly system , of course .
yes . you &apos;d better stick to the present .
what is it 70 cases a month ?
the number of cases varies . we &apos;re restricted by your letter of credit .
that sets the limit of $ 30,000 per month . it works out at about 60 to 70 crates a month .
i thought we established two credits .
can &apos;t you use the other in case of need ?
no . that credit is reserved for shipments that we make to your branches .
oh , of course , i remember .
you &apos;re. getting orders directly from the branches , with financing done by our head office .
that &apos;s right .
what are you sending to our branches nowadays ?
much the same class of goods that we send to you .
fewer electrical heating appliances , plenty of transistor radio sets .
well , for their markets down south there &apos;s a smaller demand , naturally , for heating equipment .
incidentally , we could take more of your portable radio sets and tape recorders .
that &apos;s good .
what quantities have you in mind ?
say , 5,000 transistor radios monthly , and 1,000 tape recorders .
i &apos;ll get offers from two or three of the best makers here .
when do you want their quotations ?
if possible , i will be here for about a week . then i will go over to hong kong , possibly to thailand and singapore .
do you think i could have the offers before i leave for hong kong ?
certainly , you can .
i &apos;ll have them ready by tomorrow evening .
good .
i &apos;ll cable the offers , and get the head office to start looking for additional outlets .
there &apos;s a demand , i &apos;m sure .
thank you .
multiple speed racing bicycles are a new product that the changzhou bicycle import &amp; export company intend to put on the international market .
mr. jing , a representative of the export division of the company is talking with mr. davis , a representative of a famous canadian cooperation .
mr. jing is trying to push the sale of such bicycles in the market in canada .
they are now dining at hongmei hotel in changzhou .
it is very nice of you to invite me to have chinese food .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
you now , mr. davis , there is typical chinese style cuisine in this hotel .
i like chinese food very much .
mr. davis , can you tell me what impresses most when you visited our showroom just now ?
well , your newly-designed racing bikes are very smart .
yes . they are the new models of &quot; golden lion &quot; brand , but are a lot lighter than other models .
they look colorful too .
yes .
this new model is very popular in our domestic market , especially the young people like the style very much .
you are right . young people always appeal to novel , beautiful gadgets .
mr. jing , would you like to tell me how much they weigh ?
those are made of all steel weigh around 17 kilos ; those of light aluminium alloy about 15 kilos only .
it is very impressive .
what is your model range ?
generally speaking , we have bikes for gents and ladies size 19 &quot; , 21 &quot; 25 &quot; , 27 &quot; . the colour and designs vary .
do you think our products will find market in your area ?
err . , there is possibility , of course .
however , our young buyers are rather choosy . what they like is the sound quality and famous brand .
besides , reliability is very important too .
sure .
quality includes reliability , which is our strong point .
in fact , our multiple speed racing bicycles are concentrating the essence of our technical know-how .
on the top of that , jingshi brand is well-known in the international market .
our bikes have been exported to many countries such as america , western european countries and japan , etc .
our end-users are satisfied with our products .
i believe so .
but your products are very new to our customers .
they must be handled very carefully from the beginning .
you know , it is not easy to push the sale of a new product .
surely you are right here .
but we can say that good quality and a reasonable price combined with your corporation will make our bicycles competitive in your market .
i hope so .
at the initial stage of the promotion , advertising is very important .
but you know , advertising expense must be expensive .
well , we &apos;ll send you some of our brochures , catalogues free of charge .
thank you very much .
now , mr. jing . i &apos;d like to know what your service charges will be ?
you mean commission ? that &apos;s what i am going to talk to you .
the remuneration increases with the turnover .
i &apos;d like to have the idea of the percentage .
the usual commission we allow our agent is 5 % , based on the sales turnover .
i see .
but mr. jing , i think at the very beginning the 5 % commission is a little lower .
you know , at the beginning of our sales campaign , traveling and advertising expenses must be very high .
a smooth first deal always helps the future sales .
how about 6 % commission , mr. davis ?
let &apos;s call it a deal .
i can assure you that the minimum annual turnover will reach 10,000 sets for your novel bicycles .
good .
i hope we can do a lot of business together in the future .
i am sure we can .
ganbei !
ganbei !
how are you , mr. chen ?
how are you , mr. smith ?
would it be all right for me to have look at your sample room ?
sure .
this way , please .
thank you .
entering the room
oh , what nice samples !
where shall we start ?
i &apos;m afraid it would take hours if i really look at everything .
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s first look at those items you &apos;re interested in . o. k ?
good idea !
i can just have a glance at the rest .
by the way , how long have you been in this business ?
i &apos;ve been in the line of electrical appliances for more than 20 years .
no wonder you &apos;re well experienced .
electrical appliances business has become more and more difficult to do since the competition grew more and more fiercely .
that &apos;s true .
do you have a catalogue or something that tells abut your company ?
yes .
i &apos;ll get you some later .
how many copies would you like to have ?
ten , please .
i &apos;d like to airmail some back home .
alright . this is a good idea .
we could consider some arrangements to buy from you if your price is competitive and the trade terms are favourable .
that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve taken a lot of your time today .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m very glad to have been of help .
what do you have in mind for this afternoon ?
i have some paper work to finish .
so , both of you will stay in the hotel .
okay , as for this evening , we &apos;ll hold a dinner in your honor at sichuan restaurant .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
mr. li , our manager , will host the dinner , and some other important people will also be there .
i &apos;ll be delighted to meet them .
is 6 o &apos;clock a convenient hour for you ?
yes .
in fact , any time will do .
very good .
i &apos;ll come for you at 6 o &apos;clock this evening .
this dinner will start at 6 : 30 .
well , at 9 o &apos;clock tomorrow morning , you &apos;ll take a tour up on the tiananmen gate .
a tour on the tiananmen gate ?
mr. yang , you must be kidding !
i &apos;m not .
the gate was just open to the public .
absolutely fantastic !
that &apos;s the gate on which the late chairman mao proclaimed the founding of the people &apos;s republic of china .
a tour on that gate is quite an experience even for us chinese .
after the lunch they come to ho &apos; s clothing , owned by a vietnamese who immigrated to the us only two years ago .
it &apos;s a miracle that you own such a factory .
you &apos;ve been here for only two years , you said ?
yes .
i &apos;ve borrowed money from my relatives .
i guess it must be quite an experience running business here in the us .
you can say that again .
how is your business ?
so far so good .
then why do you want to sell your machines ?
a good question .
to be frank with you , the profits i &apos;ve made from this business are not as big as i expected . so i want to sell the machines , possibly the whole business , so that i can invest elsewhere .
well , could you show us your machines and their specifications ?
sure , come over here .
this is a computer-aided designing system .
let me turn it on .
good . you can design new clothes and alter old ones on screen using this mouse .
you can also do scaling , rotating , rearranging and all kinds of other tricks on it .
once you are happy with the design , just click this button and the design will be automatically printed out to make the patterns .
can it do grading as well ?
of course it can .
just type in the new parameters and press this button . tell me which size do you want ?
size 10 .
no problem .
size 10 . here you are .
thank you .
what &apos;s this ?
a computerized embroidering machine .
again you can make the design on the computer .
the machine has twelve heads , so once you &apos;ve completed your design , it can embroider twelve identical patterns at the same time .
it &apos;s such a time saver .
after inspecting several more machines , mr. li raises the issue of price again .
you can have them at the 85 % of the invoice value .
as you can see , these are all hi-tech machines and they are all as good as new .
moreover , the prices of similar machines have gone up recently .
really ?
take this one for example . i bought it at $ 17,500 and the latest price is $ 19,000 .
so i wouldn &apos;t sell it even at the original price if i did not want to use the money to invest elsewhere .
i &apos;m afraid i can get the same machine in china even at $ 17,000. it will be brand new and need no shipping expenses .
no kidding .
well , the price must have changed again .
so , if you are really interested in selling your machines at a realistic price , it should not exceed three fifths of the original price , as most of your machines were bought one or two years ago .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s bit too low .
well , as we have one more factory to visit , please think about mr. li &apos;s bid , mr. ho . we &apos;ll come back if you are interested .
the agreement was signed this signed this afternoon .
light hearted and eager to find new business opportunities , mr. li and mr. yang came to the cocktail party at the chinese consulate in the evening .
after chatting with mr. shan wang and a few other consulate officials , they &apos;ve mingled with the other guests .
hi , mr. bowen .
glad to see you again here .
hi , mr. li and mr. yang .
i didn &apos;t know you were also coming .
we were invited to the party at the last minute .
i see anyway , it &apos;s great to be together again .
it seems we &apos;ll be partners for ever .
all right .
here &apos;s to my life long partner .
well , now that the mission &apos;s been completed , you might be eager to find new business opportunities .
right on .
look . have you met the man over there ?
the one in the dark blue suit ?
with a striped tie ?
no .
he &apos;s david taylor , a brewer with wide connections in the business circle .
perhaps he can give you some hints about new business opportunities .
could you introduce me to him ?
my pleasure .
david , i &apos;d like you to meet a friend of mine .
kang li . david taylor .
nice to meet you , mr. taylor .
nice to meet you , mr. li .
here is my business card .
thank you . here is mine .
tank you .

i &apos;m glad to meet you , mr. wang . my name is nordon . i &apos;m from sweden . this is my first visit to the fair .
welcome to the fair , mr. nordon . have you seen the exhibition halls yet ?
yes , i &apos;m especially interested in chinese arts and crafts , such as jade carvings , ivory carvings , wood and bamboo carvings as well .
i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re interested in chinese products .
yes , i &apos;m especially interested in chinese arts and crafts , such as jade carvings , wood and bamboo carvings as well .
these commodities are handled by the china arts and crafts import and export corporation . the items you mentioned are handled separately by their beijing , shanghai and tianjin branches .
do you think it is possible for me to meet them all during my visit . i plan to stay here for 5 days .
yes , i think so . i &apos;ll tell the trade delegations of your arrival and arrange the time for you to meet each of them separately .
that &apos;ll be wonderful .
if it doesn &apos;t cause you too much trouble , i hope to meet the delegates of beijing branch first , then the shanghai and tianjin .
no problem .
please have a cup of tea while you &apos;re waiting . meanwhile , i &apos;ll call up these people and make a schedule .
it &apos;s not 10 o &apos;clock . do you mind starting business this morning ?
no , of course not .
now you go back to your rooms and take a short rest .
please come downstairs at 4 : 30 p.m.and our coach will be awaiting you in front of the hotel hall .
now my watch is 5 to 4 .
do all your watches work right ?
please set your watches by my watch .
where shall we go ?
shall we go swimming as planned in the tour itinerary ?
yes .
we shall go to the famous large seashore swimming pool and have a splendid dusk .
that &apos;s great .
our coach will possibly arrive at the seashore swimming pool at 5 p.m.
we shall spend one and a half hour at that beautiful seashore .
those who love swimming can have a good fun today .
those who don &apos;t want to swim can sit at the seashore and enjoy yourselves . you can watch the splendid sunset .
shall we have supper there ?
no . today i will bring you to a special place , where you can enjoy all the famous seafood .
marvelous .
let &apos;s go and have a good rest .
i &apos;d like to take a look around your company .
o.k. i &apos;ll show you around . let &apos;s go outside .
your buildings are very large , aren &apos;t they ?
yes , they are . we &apos;re still expanding .
what &apos;s that long building ?
that &apos;s the recreation center and restaurant .
would you mind showing me your showroom ?
of course . it &apos;s on the fifth floor .
are all these goods made in your factory ?
yes , most of them are , except for the plastic parts .
i see .
by the way , how many people are working in your factory mow ?
in the factory itself we have around 1,200 employees .
mr. paul , i presume ?
yes , i &apos;m william paul , from new york .
welcome to taipei , mr. paul .
my name is david sung . i &apos;m the manager of the taiwan trading company .
i &apos;m very pleased to meet you , mr. sung .
i have a letter of introduction from the president of my company . it was very nice of you to come and meet me .
it &apos;s nothing at all , mr. paul .
i take it that you had no trouble going through customs .
none whatsoever , i &apos;m happy to say . the customs officers were all very kind and efficient .
that &apos;s good .
and how was your flight across the pacific ?
it was perfectly delightful , thanks to your country &apos;s flag carrier , the china airlines .
oh , you came by cal ?
yes , and i &apos;m glad i did , because the service was a-i .
the stewardesses were so kind and charming that i was almost tempted to propose marriage to every one of them .
and if they had all accepted , you would have become a bigamist .
but joking aside , i &apos;m glad to hear you liked cal .
i certainly did .
and now , i have a car waiting outside to take you to your hotel . right this way , please .
thank you .
are both these bags yours ?
yes .
do you have any other luggage ?
no , just these two bags .
i believe in traveling as light as i possibly can .
that &apos;s very wise .
let me carry them for you .
please don &apos;t bother . i &apos;m sure i can manage .
well , at least let me carry one of them . it &apos;s quite a walk to the exit .
all right , if you insist .
thanks very much .
gentlemen , on behalf of our company , i &apos;d like to welcome you to taiwan .
my name is jill lee .
nice to meet you , miss lee . i &apos;m leo burns .
this is bob o &apos;connor , and this is gordon weaver .
i &apos;m happy to meet you all . please , call me jill .
i &apos;d like to take a few moments to tell you about your schedule here . today through friday you &apos;ll be pretty tied up at the factory .
how far is the factory , and how are we getting there ?
a car will pick you up at 8 : 00 a.m. and it &apos;s about a 45-minute drive to the factory .
lunch is from 12 : 00 to 1 : 00 , and you &apos;ll be back at your hotel by 6 : 00 .
so , we &apos;ll be back in time to check out the nightlife !
yes , and when you do , here &apos;s some useful information .
good .
this is our first time here ; we don &apos;t know the city at all .
here are a map of the city , a list of restaurants and clubs , and a list of common expressions in mandarin chinese .
thanks .
will it be difficult for us to get around , since we can &apos;t speak chinese ?
not really . many people can speak a little english , but to play it safe , you should keep the name of your hotel written in chinese for the taxi drivers .
how about tipping ?
how much is common ?
actually , you aren &apos;t expected to tip in most places , except in international hotels .
what are some good places for shopping ?
taipei has many night markets and bazaars for inexpensive gifts .
one thing you should remember is you are expected to bargain by writing down your offer , and having the shop-owner write down his .
should we use cash ?
yes , because most places only accept nt dollars .
we &apos;re really looking forward do seeing some of the city .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll enjoy yourselves .
if there &apos;s anything i can do to help , please let me know .
good morning .
my name is smith . i &apos;m from california , usa here is my business card .
pleased to meet you , mr. smith .
my name is li ping .
pleased to meet you too , mr. li .
take a seat , please .
thank you .
may i offer you a cup of tea ?
yes . thank you .
i like your longjing tea very much .
well , from your business card , i can see that you specialize in oil-drilling equipment .
yes , as a matter of fact , we have been in this business for more than thirty years .
by the way , mr. wang from your commercial office in washington has referred me to you in the hope that i might be of some help in oil industry .
currently we have a strong interest in opening up more new oil fields , and therefore could consider some arrangements to buy from you , only if the technology incorporated in your equipment is advanced and the trade terms are favourable .
i have brought with me a series of catalogues for our latest models .
i have my engineer accompanying me on the trip .
he will be glad to meet your technicians and answer any technical questions about our products .
that &apos;s a splendid idea .
we shall , first of all , study your catalogues and get in touch with the end-users .
if they are interested , we &apos;ll arrange for further discussions .
very good .
i &apos;m staying in beijing hotel . my room number is 408 .
we &apos;ll let you know their response as soon as possible .
alright . thank you . good-bye .
good morning , mr. smith .
good morning , mr. chen .
we &apos;re meeting again .
i suppose you &apos;ve decided to accept our offer of the day before yesterday .
you know , mr. chen , although i myself feel your quotation is acceptable , i still can &apos;t accept it now as the authority given of me is limited .
i called my home office up immediately after our talk the day before yesterday , and old them of our talk and your quotation , and i also suggested that they accept it .
did they agree to your proposal ?
i just received their reply this morning and they accepted the proposal in principle .
good .
i &apos;d say , mr. smith , you &apos;ve done your share in pushing the initiative when you reported to your home office .
mr. chen , i &apos;m extremely anxious to do my part in pushing the development of trade between our two firms .
we appreciate your efforts very much .
shall we prepare the contract at once , along the lines of our last talk ?
yes , but as to the arbitration terms , my home office thinks that it &apos;s better to summit our arbitration case to an organization in a third country if any disputes arise .
i do not mean that the foreign trade arbitration commission of the china council of the promotion of international trade is not reliable , nor do i mean that any disputes should be referred to arbitration .
it is not necessary to submit a case to arbitration as long as our two parties can discuss the matter in a friendly manner .
but , mr. chen , business is business , and isn &apos;t it better t make the stipulations complete before we sign the contract ?
has your home office cabled acceptance of all the other terms ?
yes , all the other terms are acceptance provided that you agree arbitration be held in a third country-in sweden , for instance .
oh , i see .
alright , we will take this transaction as an exception and accept your request , to hold arbitration in sweden .
very good , mr. chen .
the transaction is now concluded and our talk has been a success .
yes . congratulations to you .
the same to you .
when shall i come to sign the contract ?
what about tomorrow morning , at 10 : 00 .
fine . it &apos;s perfectly alright for me .
how do you do , mr. zhang ?
how do you do , mr. johnson ?
since it &apos;s the first time i &apos;m doing business with you , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not quite clear on the arbitration clause .
is there anything particular you want to know ?
mr. zhang , would you please explain it in general ?
o. k.
generally speaking , we would like to resolve all disputes amicably by negotiations .
what if amicable negotiations fail ?
then the case may be submitted for arbitration .
mr. zhang , if there is a dispute between a chinese company and a foreign company and it goes to arbitration , in what country will the arbitration be held ?
will it be in the country of the claimant ?
or in the country of the defendant ?
it really depends on what the parties have agreed between themselves and stipulate in their arbitration agreement .
do you permit arbitration in a third country ?
yes , we do .
traditionally , our contracts did not contain provision for arbitration in a third country .
it is only in recent years that our contract clauses permit arbitration in the third countries .
the third countries include .
switzerland and sweden are most common , but canada , singapore , and others have also been included .
what procedural rules will apply , if arbitration is to take place in china ?
the cietac procedural rules will apply .
what about the applicable substantive law ?
will it be the chinese law ?
not necessarily .
in the case of a sales contract , the parties are free to choose the applicable laws and specify it in their contract .
so far as contracts involving foreign investment in china are concerned , the chinese substantive law will apply .
is the arbitral award final and binding upon the parties ?
yes , it is . and an award made in china is enforceable in another country .
and what about the cost of arbitration in china ?
is it very high ?
no , on the contrary , it is pretty low .
well , this talk is most informative .
anyway , i still prefer to settle disputes by amicable conciliation between the two parties .
i think so , too .
especially when you &apos;ve established a long-term good business relationship with us , it is usually much easier to handle the disputes through amicable negotiations .
that &apos;s true .
we thank you for your time .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
a chinese corporation has decided to import valuable medical equipments from france . since the inspection work of these equipments is very complicated , both sides agree to discuss in detail the possible problems in connection with the arbitration clause . mr. chirac , the french representative of the sellers , attends the negotiation . mr. hong , the chinese representative of buyer , is a staff member of the china medical equipment import and export corporation .
good morning , mr. chirac .
good morning , mr. hong .
very glad to see you again .
mr. chirac , the medical equipments we discussed yesterday are quite valuable .
yes , the equipments are of high quality , and very useful . so they &apos;re certainly valuable .
the design of the equipments is sophisticated , and therefore , the inspection is no easy job .
when i think of the inspection , i am worried that there might be some disputes over the results of inspection .
you needn &apos;t worry about that .
there is an arbitration clause in the contract , isn &apos;t there ?
shall we discuss the arbitration clause now ?
all right .
we always attach importance to the arbitration clause of a contract .
ok .
as the chinese saying goes &quot; to get prepared against a rainy day &quot; , we had better think more of the possible problems which might happen afterwards .
you are right .
in case of any dispute , we should try to out our differences through amicable negotiations .
if we fail to reach a settlement , we will then submit the case in dispute for arbitration to an international arbitration organization .
where do you think the arbitration will be held ?
would it be agreeable to you to adopt the customary practice that has been used in the sino-france trade ?
i don &apos;t know the customary practice in sino-france trade regarding the place for arbitration .
will you enlighten me in this regard ?
it is in the country of the defendant .
that is to say , if we submit the case for arbitration , the place for arbitration is in france and if you submit the case for arbitration , the place for arbitration is in china .
that &apos;s o. k.
the international commercial arbitration association of france is well-know for its impartiality .
they are professionally competent , and in a position to arbitrate that kind of problems arising from the quality inspection of the medical equipment .
but i am wondering if arbitration is to take place in china , what procedural rules will apply ?
the cietac procedural rules will apply .
cietac stands for china international economic and trade arbitration commission .
oh , i see . then , what about the applicable substantive law ?
generally speaking , the parties to a sales contract are free to choose the applicable law and specify it in their contract . but so far as the contracts involving foreign investment in china are concerned , the chinese substantive law will apply .
is that so ?
well , when arbitration is to take place in france , i suppose we can submit it to a standing french arbitration commission . is it all right with you ?
i &apos;m sorry , mr. chirac . we don &apos;t agree with you to submit it to a standing arbitration organization in france . it &apos;s better to submit the case to a temporary arbitration tribunal .
in that case , arbitrators are to be nominated by both parties . the arbitrators will then from a temporary arbitration tribunal . soon after the case is settled , the tribunal is dissolved .
it is a bit annoying , i think .
for a big sum of money involved , we shouldn &apos;t feel annoyed by this trouble .
i think such a tribunal consisting of arbitration from both sides will be fair and able to handle any dispute without bias or partiality .
how about the appointment of arbitrators , if arbitration is to take place in china ?
according to the chinese rules for arbitration , one or three arbitrators can be appointed . we may hold consultation to appoint a sole arbitrator . in case three arbitrators are to be appointed , each party may nominate one arbitrator from the cietac panel of arbitration .
then the third one is to be appointed by the chairman of cietac as the presiding arbitrator .
the three arbitrators so appointed will from an arbitration tribunal to hear the case .
if so , which party will pay the arbitration fee ?
well , generally speaking , all the fees for arbitration shall be borne by the losing party unless otherwise awarded by the tribunal .
and how is the arbitral award made ?
by the decision of the majority of the arbitrators .
and the arbitral award is final and binding on the parties , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
i have another question .
is an arbitral award made in china enforceable in another country ?
yes .
china is a signatory to the 1958 new york convention .
well , personally i should say it &apos;s so much better to resolve the dispute through friendly negotiations between the two parties .
i agree with you .
arbitration is only the last resort .
now let us go over the stipulations of the arbitration clause of the contract .
that &apos;s right .
i agree .
when can i have your firm c. i.f. prices , that is , the final and firm offer , mr. zhang ?
we &apos;ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . would you be free to come round then ?
good . i &apos;ll be here tomorrow morning at 10. how is that ?
perfectly . our offers remain open for 3 days .
i don &apos;t need that long to make up my mind .
if your prices are favourable and if i can get the commission i want , i will place the order right away .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find our price most favourable . elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years .
our prices haven &apos;t changed much .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
we &apos;ll be happy to .
is there anything else i can do for you , mr. clive ?
i &apos;m buying for chain department stores in canada .
they are interested in chinese carpets . i &apos;d like to make an inquiry .
could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ?
certainly . i &apos;ll make an appointment for you with mr. li of the china national native produce and animal by-products import and export corporation .
thank you very much .
this is our rock-bottom price , mr. li . we can &apos;t make any further concessions .
if that &apos;s the case , there &apos;s not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off .
what i mean is that we &apos;ll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great .
i think it is unwise for either of us to insist on his own price .
how about meeting each other half way and each makes a further concession so that business can be concluded ?
what is your proposal ?
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . when i suggested we meet each other half way , i meant it literally .
do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ?
that &apos;s impossible !
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . that &apos;ll definitely be rock-bottom .
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered .
let &apos;s meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed .
you certainly have a way of talking me into it .
all right , let &apos;s meet half way again .
i &apos;m glad we &apos;ve come to an agreement on price .
we &apos;ll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting .
yes , there &apos;s one other point i wish to clear up .
what is it ?
my friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the chinese import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently .
yes , they &apos;re right .
in fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade .
i &apos;m glad to hear that.with a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely view on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in beijing ?
basically speaking , yes . we welcome the establishment of representative offices by foreign companies in beijing . of course , there are more details to attended to . we cannot settle it in a few words .
yes , of course .
i &apos;ll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . when do we meet again ?
how about tomorrow morning at 9 ?
good . i &apos;ll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically .
good morning , mr. brown . i understand you want to discuss the price of walnutmeat with us .
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve made the offer ready for you . oh , here it is . the offer is firm for 5 days 400 pounds per metric ton cif sydney , shipment at the and of march , 1993 .
why , your price has gone up .
it &apos;s almost 10 % higher than last year &apos;s .
it would be impossible for us to make any sales at such a price .
but you certainly know the price of walnutmeat has risen greatly in the last few months . our price is still much lower than that you can get elsewhere .
you should give it an overall consideration and ours is of high quality . walnutmeat from other sources can not compare with it .
i grant that yours are of better quality . but still we don &apos;t think we can succeed in getting our customers to buy at such a high price . besides , there &apos;s keen competition from suppliers in thailand .
you can &apos;t very well ignore that .
so how about reducing the price by 5 % ?
our offer is made on the basis of many factors , including the rising trend of the world market .
if i were you , i would not worry about that at all .
taking everything into consideration , i can assure you that the price we offered to you is very favourable . i don &apos;t think you will have any difficulty in pushing sales .
to be frank with you , we would not be willing to make you a firm offer at that price if it were not for the longstanding relations between us .
but , the market prices are changing frequently . how can i be sure that the market will not fall before the arrival of goods at our port ?
it &apos;s up to you to make a decision .
if you can promise delivery before february , i &apos;ll be able to decide .
it looks as if the market won &apos;t go down until then .
the earliest delivery we can effect is in march , but we can assure you that we &apos;ll do our best to advance the shipment .
all right .
may i ask if you allow any commission ?
from european suppliers i usually get a 5 % commission on my imports .
it &apos;s the general practice .
we don &apos;t want to bargain . we usually allow a 3 % commission .
well , if that &apos;s the case , i suppose i &apos;ll have to do the same , won &apos;t i ?
comrade zhao , manager of the china national cereals , oils and foodstuffs import and export corporation , had a talk with mr. howard griffin , assistant manager of t.g. salgo &amp; co . melbourne , australia .
welcome to beijing , mr. girffin .
thank you . i &apos;m glad i was able to come .
did you have a pleasant trip ?
not really .
we ran into a thunderstorm over hong kong , and the airplane was so tossed about that everyone got airsick .
is that so ?
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
i hope you had a good rest after that .
i had a very restful night .
xinqiao hotel is a nice quiet place .
i &apos;m quite myself again .
shall we take up the tallow business now ?
that &apos;s fine with me .
i &apos;m ready .
in your reply to our enquiry , you clearly stated the reasons why you couldn &apos;t make us an offer at the time and suggested a personal talk about this .
will it be possible for you to resume negotiating the deal now ?
please accept my apologies for our inability to be more responsive to your enquiry .
that &apos;s all right . unforeseen circumstances do occur , don &apos;t they ?
they do . you see , when we received your enquiry , the would market was suffering from a currency crisis , which made it difficult for us to make a firm offer .
now that is more or less over , at least for the time being .
i presume you know where you stand now .
yes , i feel we &apos;re in a position , hopefully , to take up the business negotiation again .
but in those uncertain days about two weeks ago , most of the exporters at our end didn &apos;t want to commit themselves .
u.s. dollar devaluation was imminent , and sterling was also under heavy pressure . we couldn &apos;t afford to take any chances .
yes , we understand your position .
and i &apos;m glad the situation is taking a turn for the better .
luckily we &apos;ve pulled though this solid footing , we have come personally to explain the position .
good . we look forward to doing business with you in the years to come .
me too .
however , the tallow market has been quite strong for sometime and the prevailing price in the australian market is around us $ 303 / mt for bulk tallow .
oh , mr. griffin , as a state enterprise handling the import of tallow , i &apos;m sure you expect us to do some investigation into prices before making an enquiry .
your price is quite unreasonable .
it is ridiculous , if i may say so .
well , i &apos;m sorry to say that we find it quite unacceptable .
could you give me an indication as to a price which you consider workable ?
i suggest that you reconsider your price once more , and bring it into line with the international market price .
well , i &apos;d be glad to hear what price you have in mind .
i can only say that the prices from other sources are much lower than your and that their quality of tallow is very good .
mr. zhao , let &apos;s be frank . this is not the first time we &apos;ve done business together . we &apos;ve always been straight and fair with each other . there &apos;s nothing serious to complain about . but the currency fluctuations could be responsible for some of our difficulties in pricing .
we really have been put in an awkward position because of this .
yes , it &apos;s good that our past record has always been satisfactory .
still , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll lose out if you don &apos;t fall into line with the prices of others .
i think i should explain briefly .
the rate of inflation around the world is from 3-9 % while the rise in price for tallow is only 5 % compared with our last transaction . the seeming 15 % rise in our offer is caused by the precipitous slide of the dollar .
in other world , it &apos;s the rate of exchange of foreign currency that makes our price seem so unfavorable .
i think you should realize that .
indeed we do .
but you should not neglect the advantage you enjoy in the cost of production .
after all , we &apos;re quite prepared to come to terms with you if your price is reasonable .
think it over , mr. griffin .
well , i shall need more time as i have to contact my head office .
that &apos;s fine .
could you let us know as soon as you hear from them ?
certainly , i will .
mr. wang , i hope i &apos;m not late .
did you say 9 o &apos;clock ?
yes , mr. haffman . you are here right on time . we have just arrived too .
good . have you any news for me today , mr. wang ?
we had a further look at your quotation after the talk yesterday afternoon . after going through the world steel market situation in the last few days , we still feel that it is not enough for you to reduce your original price of $ 200 per m / t by only 2 % .
as i told you yesterday , in the past 6 months , a surplus of steel has appeared in the japanese , american and western european markets .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t agree with you there , mr. wang .
i grant that in the past half a yeat , the japanese and americans have sometimes found it difficult to sell their because of slight setback in the world economic situation . however , we in germany , have had no problems .
is that so ?
why then ?
because we always keep an eye on the east european market .
in this market we have a geographical advantage compared with our competitors from japan and the u. s.
but , you should consider the fact that the japanese are taking a more advantageous position than you are in trade with china .
that &apos;s true , geographically speaking , but i should say that when you compare the price , you should also compare the quality of the good . your end-users should have given you their comments on the quality of steel imports from different countries .
yes , yours is of good quality , but they did not tell us the imported steel from other sources is bad in quality .
in any case , they regard our steel favourably and make no comments on steel imported from other sources .
you can make a comparison here , mr. wang .
ah , mr. haffman , you really have a way of taking me into it . however , there still exists a large gap in price . couldn &apos;t you take another step down and reduce the price by , say , 2 % again , and then , perhaps we &apos;ll think your quotation workable .
i hate to disappoint you , mr. wang , but i &apos;m not authorized to agree to such a big reduction .
would you mind waiting a day or two , until i get a reply from my home office ?
not at all . we &apos;ll wait one or two days .
i &apos;ve brought you some good new , mr. wang .
has your corporation agreed to another reduction of 2 % in price ?
yes , may i now repeat our offer as 5 000 m / t steel , specifications as shown in our catalogue at us $ 192.00 per m / t fob hamburg , shipment sep . / oct . 1992 .
yes , that &apos;s it .
mr. wang , i tell you , our offer holds firm for only one day , that means it is subject to your immediate acceptance .
o.k. , w confirm our acceptance of your offer .
all right .
when shall i come to sign the contract ?
what about tomorrow , say 10 : 00 a. m ?
o. k.
i understand this is your first visit to our corporation .
yes , and also my first visit to china . i &apos;ve always wanted to see with my own eyes china &apos;s achievements and now i &apos;ve been more than rewarded .
thank you . i hope you &apos;ve had a pleasant trip .
i did , thank you .
well , let &apos;s come to the pint , the purpose of my coming here is to inquire about possibilities of establishing trade relations with your corporation .
that &apos;s fine .
let me assure you of four best attention , mr. smith , what &apos;s your line of business ?
leather crafts .
we are distributors with business branches in most major cities in america .
now , we &apos;d like to introduce chinese-made leather crafts , if your price is competitive and sales conditions are favourable .
we &apos;ll see what we can do .
there might be quite a few kinds of your leather crafts we would be interested in , may i go over your latest catalogues ?
sure . here you are . how many copies would you like to have ?
ten , please .
i &apos;d like to airmail some back home .
of course , that &apos;s a good idea .
anything else ?
would it be all right for me to have a closer look at your samples ?
why not ?
mr. chen over there will take you down to our showroom .
thank you . i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve taken a lot of your time .
not at all .
glad to have been of help .
hope to see more of you when you are here in beijing .
i hope so , too .
mr. zhang , director liu has referred me to you , for a discussion on our import requirements .
to begin with , i &apos;d like to give you some information about our delegation .
the members of our delegation are the leading importers and suppliers of garments and textile goods for department stores in our country .
we &apos;re very pleased to be of help to you .
welcome to beijing . i can assure you of our close cooperation .
from what i have learned , i am sure we can develop business with your corporation on a large scale . i believe we can expect a fair deal between you and us .
many business people speak highly of your commercial integrity .
we always adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit . all contracts are honoured and carried out to the letter .
so i &apos;ve heard .
we hope we can have an opportunity to visit some textile mills here .
yes , that can be arranged .
i &apos;ll let you know the time schedule later .
thank you .
the china coal import and export corporation intends to import coal cutters from germany . to save foreign exchange , compensation trade is considered preferable by the chinese side . negotiations are conducted between mr. xu who represents the chinese side and mr. peter scholtissek who represent the cologne company of germany .
glad to meet you , mr. scholtissek .
the purpose of inviting you to come here is to discuss the purchase of some long wall coal cutters .
good .
our coal cutters are very advanced in technology , aren &apos;t they ?
yes , they are a bit better than the coal cutters we just purchased from other countries .
but your price is skyrocketing , and much higher than those from other countries .
well , the way i think , you shouldn &apos;t consider the price only , but also its efficiency .
yes , we are satisfied with the efficiency of your cutters , but being short of foreign exchange , we must plan our purchases according to our means .
therefore it &apos;s difficult for us to buy the coal cutters of your production this year .
furthermore , those of other brands are not so bad at all .
if so , can we consider the possibility of undertaking compensation trade ?
why not ?
we &apos;d be happy to negotiate with you for such a deal .
which do you prefer , buy-back or counter purchase ?
i guess that buy-back is easier .
since we do often import a lot of coal from abroad , you can pay for the coal cutters with the coal produced by them .
that sounds very promising .
do you wish to have total compensation trade or a partial one ?
it depends very much upon your payment capability .
in other words , the more you can produce in a given period of time , the sooner you will be able to pay for the cutters .
i understand the whole process .
as for us , it &apos;s better to do total compensation trade .
it &apos;s quite alright to me .
total compensation trade maybe good for both of us .
for instance , you &apos;ll buy from us four coal cutters at the unit price of 6 million us dollars . all of them will the paid for with the coal produced by the machines .
we would like to know how long it will take to complete the payment .
of course , the sooner the better .
if we do some calculation on the basis of the cutters &apos; production capacity and the current price of coal , it will take about two years to complete the payment .
how do you like it ?
may i say that your estimation does not seem to be 100 % correct ?
compensation trade is , in a way , a kind of loan you need to pay the interest on the loan every year .
in that case , i &apos;m afraid , payment cannot be completed within two years .
you are right .
it can &apos;t be completed in two years .
will three years be long enough ?
i think so .
that &apos;s settled . we &apos;ll complete payment within three years from the commencement of coal production .
may i remind you of your definite responsibilities for technical assistance , the performance of the machines and finally a smooth and successful start-up .
certainly we &apos;ll fulfill our obligations .
meanwhile , it &apos;s our hope that you &apos;ll meet our requirements on the varieties . quantity and quality specifications and the time of shipment for all the coal you deliver to us .
we &apos;ll certainly act in accordance with the contract terms .
good .
would you please get the draft contract ready as soon as possible ?
yes , we will .
a japanese company has imported from china a considerable quantity of silk goods every year . since the company is going to reduce the import of silk from china this year , they send mr. tanaka to beijing for a discussion on import licence . mr. zhao from china textiles import and export corporation meets with him .
how are you , mr. tanaka ?
i &apos;m fine , thank you .
mr. zhao , i &apos;m sorry to say that i don &apos;t bring any good news with me this time .
well , that is a surprise to me . what is the bad news ?
it is rather beyond our expectation .
this year our government has adopted a special licence system for the import of textiles , including silk goods .
oh , that &apos;s not too bad . as i understand it , from now on , silk goods can be imported only from the countries or regions nominated by the government .
yes . no importation of silk goods is allowed from other than the six nominated countries or regions which include china ?
is there any quantity limitation for the import of silk goods from china .
i &apos;m not sure . it all depends upon the government &apos;s regulations .
the imports have to apply for an import licence for each specific purchase .
considering the total number of the importers , we estimate that the maximum quantity of silk goods we ca buy from china this year is about 50 million japanese yen .
i know the import licences were also required last year . how did you place an order for 60 million japanese yen of silk goods last year ?
last year &apos;s regulations are no longer in effect this year . what the government issued to us last year was a general licence .
right . mr. tanaka , as i remember , you placed an order of 60 million japanese yen worth of silk goods last year , but in fact only 30 million japanese yen worth of silk goods were shipped owing to our heavy backlog of orders on hand , and as a result , we would not fulfill your order completely .
yes , that &apos;s true .
is it possible to transfer the remaining part of the specified quantity of last year &apos;s import licence to that of this year &apos;s import licence ?
no , it &apos;s not possible .
it is the same as in china , the import licence holds good only for one year inn japan .
that is to say , the licence of fast year , under which the import quantity is not fully used up , is null and void now .
right .
if you want to import again this year , you will have to apply for a new licence .
why is your government so strict on the control of imports of silk goods ?
it &apos;s probably designed to protect the silk textile industry in japan or to avoid too many imports of silk goods .
o. k.
there &apos;s no point in discussing it further .
whatever amount of an order from you is welcome .
i wish that you understand our situation .
we can only follow the government &apos;s directive .
i hope to get a general import licence again next year .
if so , i &apos;ll buy more from china .
i wish you every success .
all right .
now , shall we discuss something more concrete ?
okay .
i was wondering if you would give us a response to our fax inquiry .
certainly .
we are pleased to offer you 120,000 cotton poplin blouses at us $ 16.80 each , fob xingang .
the blouses will be packed in plastic bags , each four dozens in a corrugated cardboard box .
they will be delivered in two consignments of 60,000 each , the first by august 20 and the second by september 10 .
the terms of payment will be the same as those in the previous contract , that is , sight letter of credit .
thank you very much for your offer , and we &apos;ll give it serious consideration .
as it &apos;ll take us some time to calculate , may i suggest we take a 20-minute break ?
then we &apos;ll give you an answer .
fine .
after the break .
well , mr. li . i &apos;ve discussed your offer with guy , and i &apos;m afraid we found it rather on the high side .
i wonder why you think so .
to be honest with you , just before we left for china , we were approached by a filipino garments manufacturer .
his offer was us $ 13.50 each blouse .
so , we don &apos;t see why we should pay more for your blouses .
us $ 13.50 each blouse ? really ?
that &apos;s right , us $ 13.50 .
that &apos;s really cheap .
i guess you must have bought a lot from him ?
we bought 1,000 pieces .
only 1,000 ?
well , as we don &apos;t know much about that firm , so we just placed a trial order .
right , it takes time to find out whether a business partner is trustworthy .
this is why we sent our inquiry to you .
i believe you are not only trustworthy but also competitive in price .
you bet .
but your offer is obviously far from competitive .
then what do you think would be a competitive price ?
$ 13.50 , the price we paid the filipino firm .
oh come on , our blouses certainly deserve more than that .
oh , why ?
because our quality is high , and high quality goods deserve high prices .
mr. bowen , you wouldn &apos;t disagree on that , would you ?
you may have a point there .
but , how can you prove your blouses are better than the filipino ones ?
our blouses are one hundred percent natural : they are pure cotton .
well , that &apos;s certainly a plus for you .
this year , we have also won a gold medal from the best commodities expo sponsored by the general association of textiles .
here is the certificate from the association .
i take off my hat to you , mr. li .
thank you , but i think the best evidence is this : the orders we have received from overseas customers have doubled in the last three years .
this is our sales report .
thank you .
after the break
well , mr. bowen , during the break i went over what we have already achieved .
so did i
and i found that , compared with what we have already agreed on , our difference is almost nothing .
at this stage , i don &apos;t think you would like the idea of coming all the way to china only to go back home empty handed . and we don &apos;t want to see that either .
so . it would be a crime if we let this one dollar difference stand in our way to the new contract .
that &apos;s true .
so i suggest we repeat what we did for the terms of payment and meet each other half way .
in other words let &apos;s split the difference .
then it would be $ 15.40 .
i doubt if we can ever make any profit at this price .
sure you can .
i &apos;ll have to think about it .
mr. bowen , what you will sell is the most competitive blouses in the world .
if you advertise them well , they &apos;ll sell like hot cakes , and you will be surprised at your profits .
well , i &apos;ll take your word for it .
good . we &apos;ve come to an agreement at last .
let me make a quick summary .
we &apos;ll sell you 120,000 cotton poplin blouses at us $ 15.40 per piece fob xingang .
the blouses will be delivered in two consignments of 60,000 pieces each .
the first consignment will be paid by sight l / c and the second by sight d / p.
am i correct ?
yes .
great .
now what do you suggest we work on next ?
what about delivery ?
good .
we &apos;ll deliver the first consignment in tow months , that is , by august 20 .
could you make it a bit earlier ?
say , the beginning of august ?
i &apos;d like to deliver earlier , because if we did so we could have the payment earlier , but i can &apos;t give you a check whack i know will bounce .
look , mr. li , in our market , october is the season for this kind of blouses .
look at this reverse timetable .
the goods must clear the us customs before september 20 it they are to reach our retailers by october .
september 20 . you &apos;ll still have one month if we deliver the goods by august 20 .
yes , but in order to clear the customs before september 20 , the goods must arrive at the port of destination before september 1 .
why should the goods arrive so early ?
because the procedures the imported textiles have to go through can be outrageously time-consuming .
twenty days to pass the customs ?
i really can &apos;t understand .
the us customs has in the past few months become very picky on imported textiles .
it takes ten days on average , but there have been cases in which it took one month to clear the customs .
so i must prepare for the worst .
i see .
now they start working on the claim clause .
do you really think it &apos;s necessary , mr. bowen , to have a clause of claim ?
we &apos;ve been doing business for so many years .
i know , and i must add that we &apos;ve had a very pleasant relationship .
then why do you still want this claim clauses ?
just a sound business practice .
let me give you an example .
i &apos;m a great believer in japanese consumer electronics .
i &apos;ve bought a japanese quartz watch , a japanese color tv set and a japanese video recorder , and none of theme has given me any trouble .
now suppose i want to buy a japanese camcorder . do i still need a warranty ?
i figure you do .
right , because i want to be one hundred percent sure that the machine will not go wrong even if the chance is virtually nil .
this is also true for this contract .
being business partners for so long , we know each other &apos;s integrity perfectly well .
but , there are factors which might be beyond our expectation or control .
so neither of us should take chances .
all right , if you insist , let &apos;s work on it .
how would you like to go about it ?
i think there are two problems that may cause claims : inferior quality and late delivery .
inferior quality will force the garments to sell at a discount or to become completely unsalable .
on the other hand , late delivery will also cause problems , because once you miss the season , you &apos;ll miss the profits .
i agree .
then what do you suggest we discuss first ?
shall we work on quality first ?
fine .
first , i want to re-emphasize that on the whole we &apos;ve been satisfied with the quality of your products .
thank you .
but i also want to point out that sometimes the quality of your products is inconsistent .
could you give me an example ?
we &apos;ve received some complaints from our retailers about the buttonholing of some of the shirts in your last consignment .
they said the stitches are either too thick or too thin .
well , i &apos;m afraid that kind of problem is unavoidable in mass production .
but the competition is fierce .
our retailers said if they could find someone with better products , they would on longer place orders with us .
this is why i insist on this claim clause .
you want to use this claim clause to remind us of the competition .
exactly .
i hope i &apos;ll never have to invoke this clause and lodge a claim with you .
i just want you to step into my shoes and feel the pressure .
the categorization is fine with me .
what about the penalty rates ?
i suggest we use a flat rate for the penalty .
that is , for each defective blouse , the penalty will be the value of the blouse .
does this rate apply to major defects or minor ones ?
major ones .
for minor ones , the penalty will be 20 % of the value .
your rate is surely simple to calculate , but , as i said before , i do not insist on this claim clause because we want to eventually use it .
rather , i hope there will be no defect or as few defects as possible so that we &apos;ll never have to lodge a claim with you .
in this spirit , i suggest we adopt a progressive penalty rate .
could you spell it out ?
for major defects , if the defect rate does not exceed 0.1 % , the penalty rate will be 0.05 % of the contract value . from 0.1 % to 0.5 % inclusive , the penalty rate will be 1 % . from 0.5 % to 1 % inclusive , the penalty rate will be 30 % . from 1 % to 5 % inclusive , the penalty rate will be 70 % .
the penalty rate will be 200 % and the whole lot will be returned to you if the defect rate exceeds 5 % .
do you really think it should be this complicated ?
i &apos;m afraid my answer is yes , but i hope we &apos;ll never have to use it .
all right .
i think this progressive rate is actually more to my advantage , because i have confidence in my products .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
so shall we apply the same principle to the minor defects ?
why not ?
after almost six hours &apos; negotiation , mr. li and mr. bowen have reached agreement on everything .
mr. li asks mr. yang to draft the contract , which will be signed by the two parties the following morning .
the next morning , the two parties came to dafa garments again .
after checking the contract carefully , mr. li and mr. bowen put their signatures on the contract .
if i remember correctly , this is the eighteenth contract i &apos;ve signed with dafa garments .
you are right .
my hunch is that this contract will become a milestone in our relationship .
why ?
because eighteen is a lucky number in chinese .
i see .
but . well , mr. li , i &apos;m afraid we both have to make extra efforts if our relationship is to develop further .
i agree .
we &apos;ve always appreciated the competitiveness of your prices , but as i said earlier , the quality of your garments is sometimes inconsistent , and the delivery is not always on schedule .
i have to admit that &apos;s true .
we were lucky that our sales did not suffer much as a result , but we cannot always count on our luck . don &apos;t you agree , mr. li ?
i agree .
the problem is that the pressure on us for fast delivery has increased greatly .
i remember that ten years ago you would be happy if we shipped the goods in three months .
but in the past few years , you &apos;ve often asked us to deliver in two months , or even sooner .
because the time we have to respond to our clients &apos; tastes has also become unbearably limited .
and if we can &apos;t satisfy our clients &apos; needs in time , they will certainly turn to our competitors .
we &apos;ve tried our best to be punctual , but sometimes it was just impossible to deliver on time ; and sometimes we had to rush , and as a result the quality might have suffered .
wednesday morning at willshire fashion &apos;s conference room .
after greetings and some chatting , the negotiation begins .
in our letter of intent and the subsequent communications , we &apos;ve agreed on the principles of the compensation trade package .
that is , we will provide you with advanced garments machinery and you will compensate us with garments .
correct .
we &apos;ve further agreed that , in order to minimize the costs , the machines can be second-hand so long as their specifications and conditions satisfy your needs .
that &apos;s right .
so far i &apos;ve received three offers of second-hand garment machinery .
before we visit the factories and negotiate with the owners , however , i &apos;m afraid we should first agree on how to finance the package .
how to finance the package ?
i don &apos;t quite understand .
you just buy the machines and we &apos;ll compensate you with garments .
it means that we , the seller , will provide the credit .
or in other words , we will finance the trade .
now i see what you mean , but that &apos;s what the compensation trade is all about .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s entirely possible for it to be the other way round .
that is , you sell us the garments first and we give you the machines later .
that &apos;s certainly another possibility , but it is rather rare in compensation trade and simply won &apos;t work in our case .
we need the machines before we can improve our quality and delivery , not after .
well , you certainly have a point there .
so we &apos;ll have to finance it .
now , the problem is how much the total payment is .
after the break .
now let &apos;s work on something else .
shall we discuss the method for compensation ?
fine .
i suggest that every time you make a purchase , you don &apos;t have to physically pay for it . its value will be deducted from what we owe you .
this will continue until you are fully compensated .
i &apos;m afraid we should not tie the two payments together .
why ?
i think this will reduce the financing costs and save both of us a lot of trouble .
sure it will reduce costs and save trouble , but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not a sound business practice .
why ?
because there is no guarantee that both of us will be paid properly .
what if we can &apos;t buy from you , or you can &apos;t sell to us , in the middle of the compensation ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re a bit too pessimistic , mr. bowen .
well , mr. li , we both know that any thing could happen in international business and we should leave no risk unattended .
very well , whatever you say .
in the best interests of both you and me , i suggest that we make separate payments for machines and garments .
all right .
now let &apos;s look at the terms of payment .
what &apos;s your suggestion for that ?
i suggest payment with either l / c or collections , depending on which is our priority , security or costs .
i &apos;d prefer l / c , because what we &apos;ll be involved in is no small deal .
security should come first .
it will do both of us good , don &apos;t you agree , mr. li ?
i do .
so we &apos;ll open separate l / c &apos;s for machines and garments .
yes .
you &apos;ll open a 180-day since l / c , depending on the final figure of our financing .
and we &apos;ll open a sight l / c each time we make a purchase from you .
i have no objections .
now that you have our guarantee that your money will be paid back in time , i think it is fair for us to ask you for the same .
what &apos;s that ?
would you please also guarantee that by the time our issuance l / c is due , the accumulative value of your purchase from us will be the same as that of our l / c.
i &apos;ll try my best .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not a guarantee .
i &apos;d like to buy as much as possible from you , but as i said earlier there are many uncertainties .
granted , but if you don &apos;t buy from us , where can we find the money to pay you back ?
i didn &apos;t say we wouldn &apos;t buy from you .
besides , willshire fashion is not the only source of your revenue .
you have many other clients .
that &apos;s true but it &apos;s just not fair .
you have our guarantee and we don &apos;t have yours .
i &apos;ve said we &apos;ll do our best .
and i &apos;ve also said it &apos;s not a guarantee .
it seems we &apos;ll get nowhere if we go on like this well , as it &apos;s already quite late , shall we agree on the general principles today and work out the details later ?
all right .
i agree to the general principle of separate payments , but i &apos;ll raise the issue of counter guarantee again after we visit the factories .
okay .
after the demo
how much is your offer for this machine ?
i &apos;m a very reasonable man .
look , this is the original invoice for this machine .
see the original price ?
and as you &apos;re from such a remote country , i &apos;ll sell them to you at half of the original price .
thank you .
but as the date of the invoice indicates , this machine has been in use for already four years .
you &apos;re right .
and we usually depreciate our machinery in ten years , so it still has three-fifths of the original value .
my friend told me on our way here that most garments makers here in the states depreciate their machinery in just five years .
so this machine is worth only one-fifth of its original value .
that &apos;s not the way i calculate .
all right . very soon we &apos;ll find out the main steam practice as we will visit a few more garments makers .
just as mr. bowen has expected , mr. ho says his offer is negotiable .
so on friday morning , mr. bowen , mr. li and mr. yang are returning to mr. ho &apos;s office .
on their way , they have been discussing what should be included in the contract with mr-ho .
i think we should add a clause saying that ho &apos;s clothing should provide all the technical documentation so that the machines will run properly .
right .
in addition , i suggest that dafa garments have a representative when the machines are dismantled , packed and shipped .
without his consent , the machines would be considered unacceptable .
well , i have no objections .
as i &apos;m going back very soon , i &apos;ll send my chief engineer to oversee the dismantlement .
but it &apos;ll take at least two weeks for your chief engineer to get the visa .
do you want to wait that long ?
i think i can wait .
the travel will cause additional expenses .
i think it &apos;s worth it .
i want to make double sure that the machines are the ones we want to buy and that they are in good shape .
surely you want to do that .
here i want to emphasize that you and your people have my utmost trust .
the reason i want to send my chief engineer here is very simple : he is the best person to make sure we get everything that is needed for the machines to run properly in china .
i would do the same if i were you .
after a whole day &apos;s hard work , mr. bowen and mr. ho have concluded a contract .
according to the contract , the total payment for the machines is $ 254,300 , very close to mr. li &apos;s original bid .
now they are on their way back .
it &apos;s a real bargain .
thank you so much , mr. bowen .
don &apos;t mention it . we &apos;re partners , aren &apos;t we ?
right .
now that we &apos;ve got the exact figure for the total payment , i think it &apos;s time to draft a formal agreement for the package .
i hope we can sign it in the coming monday .
let mr. yang do the drafting .
you have worked very hard this week , so both of you should have your weekend off .
i &apos;ll ask my secretary to do the job .
well , it &apos;s almost four o &apos;clock .
i &apos;ll dictate the draft to her as soon as i &apos;m back at my office .
i think she &apos;ll have the full blown agreement ready for your approval monday afternoon .
good .
if you fink the agreement satisfactory , we can sign it in the same afternoon .
fantastic !
i &apos;d like to make a little change .
i &apos;ll open a 120-day issuance l / c for the two thirds of your financing .
the balance will be covered by another l / c , depending on the amount of your purchase .
oh come on , mr. li , you &apos;ve again tied the two payments together .
no , they are still separate .
we only want some guarantee , just as you did to us .
remember that it is we who finance the deal , and as the beneficiary , you are obliged to make the full payment .
i didn &apos;t say i wouldn &apos;t do that .
what i mean is that , as a partner in compensation trade , you also have your obligation , that is , to go on purchasing our garments until the compensation is complete .
that &apos;s what compensation trade is all about .
well , mr. li , you &apos;ve really got me there .
i just want to make it fairer .
all right .
what about paying four fifths first ?
i &apos;m afraid three quarters are the best i can accept .
well , well , i guess there is no other way out , is there ?
if you agree to this , would you please revise the agreement accordingly ?
all right .
to be frank with you , mr. li , i &apos;m beginning to doubt if it is wise at all for us to tie ourselves up like this .
all these inconveniences will far outweigh the gains , if there are any , we can get from this deal .
don &apos;t be so pessimistic , mr. bowen .
as a chinese proverb has it , &quot; never fear , if you &apos;re well prepared . &quot;
and to quote a famous phrase of yours , &quot; it &apos;s a sound business practice . &quot;
the reality may be far brighter than it looks .
what makes you so optimistic ?
we &apos;ve prepared for the worst , that is , if your purchase from us cannot offset what we owe you .
experiences show that the worst will probably not happen if you are fully prepared for it .
more often than not , you &apos;d end up with something far better than what you are prepared for .
that &apos;s pure theory .
it may well be the reality .
what if we receive one or several big orders from other clients ?
then we would have enough cash to pay you back in full well ahead of schedule .
sounds good .
so do you agree to make the calculation more flexible ?
yes i do .
i suggest we have separate clause for interest payment .
okay .
the payment of interest shall be calculated as follows .
excellent .
now we &apos;ve taken care of the best as well as the worst .
anything else would you like to discuss ?
i &apos;m perfectly happy with the rest of the draft .
very good .
i &apos;ll ask my secretary to revise the agreement according to our discussion this morning .
i think the new version will be ready for our signatures this afternoon .
good .
please tell me a bit more about exclusive sales arrangements in china .
are they different from such arrangements here in the states ?
i think they &apos;re basically the same the world around : the exporter authorizes the importer to be the sole dealer of the former &apos; s products .
if the exporter has several product lines , could he specify which product lines he wants included in the arrangement ?
yes .
based on his judgment of importer &apos;s strength and channel of distribution , the exporter can also specify the area in which the importer can sell the specified products .
it can be one city , several provinces or the whole country .
what about the length of such an arrangement ?
it depends , usually one year .
here in the states , we do not specify the length . instead , we have a clause of termination or renewal of the arrangement in the related agreement .
that seems moue flexible .
what about the volume of the business ?
it &apos;s also specified in the arrangement , expressed in either quantity or value .
once agreed upon , it is the obligation of the parties involved to sell or buy the specified amount of products .
any other obligations ?
yes .
the exporter is obliged to sell the specified products during the specified period to nobody but the importer .
the importer has his own obligations , too . that is , during the specified period , he should buy from the exporter only , if his country &apos;s law permits .
what if the importer does not make a profit ?
well , he has nobody but himself to blame , because in an exclusive sales arrangement , the relationship between the exporter and the importer is &quot; principal to principal &quot; .
this means each party is responsible for his own profits or losses .
that &apos;s the same here .
now assume that you have an agency arrangement in china , is the relationship different ?
yes .
in an agency arrangement , the owner of the goods authorizes an individual or a firm to be his agent .
the agent does business on behalf of the goods &apos; owner .
so , it &apos;s a &quot; principal to agent &quot; relationship .
you &apos;re right .
the owner of the goods is the principal .
the agent operates with the principal &apos;s funds and sell goods for him , but is not responsible for the losses or the profits of the operation .
sounds like an easy job .
i know you are kidding .
every agent will do his best to maximize sales for his principal , because he lives on commission which is usually a percentage of the sales he makes .
the more sales he makes , the more commissions he will get .
that &apos;s right .
in the states , there are basically three types of agents : commission agents , exclusive agents and general agents .
it &apos;s the same in china .
a commission agent is not exclusive .
the principal can appoint one or several commission agents in the same area at the same time .
after the agents are appointed , can the principal sell directly to buyers in the same area without the involvement of the agent ?
he can , and if this is the case , the agent will get no commission .
the poor agent !
once the principal is familiar with an agent and is convinced of the agent &apos;s strength , he may appoint the latter as the exclusive agent for a certain area .
in an exclusive agency arrangement , only one agent can be appointed in the same area at the same time .
so the agent enjoys exclusive rights .
right .
direct sales by the principal are still allowed , but the principal has to pay the agent commission no matter who sells the goods , unless otherwise stipulated .
that &apos;s fair , because in such an arrangement the agent is not allowed to sell goods made by the principal &apos;s competitors .
that &apos;s right .
the third type of agents are general agents .
a general agent represents the principal in a bigger area and is give more authorization .
he can also appoint agents working under him and share their commissions .
it &apos;s quite similar here .
well , there seems to be little difference between us so long as agency is concerned , right ?
we do have a lot in common .
as china opens her door wider to the world , more international norms will be adopted in her relations with other countries .
you &apos;ve been most informative , mr. li .
it &apos;s my pleasure to help other people learn about china .
and i &apos;d like to learn more .
but before we go on , could i have a refill ?
go ahead , and i &apos;d like to do the same .
well , this wine tastes great .
it &apos; s dynasty , brewed in china .
so i &apos;ve noticed .
as a matter of fact , the brewery is a sino-french joint venture .
pardon , what kind of joint venture ?
a sino-french joint venture .
really .
it seems more and more foreign firms have investment in china .
that &apos;s right .
the foreign investment in china has more than quadrupled in the past decade .
that &apos;s great .
could you tell me why it has increased do fast ?
these are two reasons .
first , the chinese government has done everything it can to attract foreign investment .
second , for many foreigners it will be more profitable if they have direct investment in china than if they just trade with china .
could you give me some examples ?
sure .
as i &apos;m in garments business , could i use garments as an example ?
sure .
in international garments trading , most of the exporters are in developing countries like china .
we have cheap labor , land , buildings and raw materials , but lack funds , technology and managerial expertise .
so if a foreigner invests in china with funds , technology and managerial expertise , he &apos;ll have the best of everything and can thus maximize his profits .
sounds encouraging .
mr. li , where do you think is the best place to invest in china ?
the coastal cities have many advantages , as transportation and communications facilities there are much better than those in inland cities .
but as china speeds up its economic reform , many inland cities are catching up quickly .
i see .
what kind of forms do foreign investment in china usually take ?
well , there are compensation trade , co-exploration , joint venture , business solely owned by foreigners , just to name a few .
could you explain them one by one ?
sure .
compensation trade , sometimes also called counter trade or simply ct , is just what the name suggests .
in such kind of trade , the foreign partner usually supplies machinery and technology , and the home partner then compensates the foreign partner with products made with the machinery and technology .
got it ?
yes , thank you .
what &apos;s the second type of investment you mentioned ?
co-exploration , also called co-development .
you know , countries like china are rich in natural resources but lack the funds to exploit them .
so the government sometimes enters agreement with foreign investors for natural resource exploration .
could you give me some examples ?
in the past decade , the chinese government has signed contracts with american , french , british and dutch oil companies for the exploration of china &apos;s offshore oil .
how much do foreign companies have to invest in such co-exploration ?
at least millions of dollars .
how much are the risks ?
i should say the risks are also great .
if the venture fails to find oil , the loss could also be in the millions .
i &apos;m afraid the risks are too great to take .
the risks are great because no one can guarantee he can find oil every time he sinks a well .
but the gains must also be huge if the oil is found .
right .
if oil is found , the foreign investor will be given priority in the actual exploitation of the oil field .
then the profits will pour in .
good .
now , what &apos;s next , the joint venture ?
yes .
a joint venture is a business with both chinese and foreign investments .
after exchanging business cards , mr. li and mr. bush have talked about their respective companies for a while .
oh mr. bush , how i envy you .
oh why ?
as a sportswear maker , you must have a huge market in such a sports superpower as your country .
the market is surely huge , but the competition is also fierce .
that &apos;s for sure .
who doesn &apos;t want a bite of such a lucrative business ?
exactly .
so we &apos;re looking for ways to outperform our competitors .
could you tell me a bit more about it ? that is , if it &apos;s not a business secret .
it &apos;s no secret at all .
in the past few months , we &apos;ve been considering the possibility of transferring some of our manufacturing to china as a way to reduce production costs .
our marketing people have dome some studies , but their data are mostly second hand .
i guess this is why you came to this party .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;d like to have some face-to-face contact with people like you .
now mr. li , could you tell me , if we are to set up a manufacturing company in china , what would be the best way to go about it ?
you may set up a company completely owned by yourselves or a joint venture with a chinese partner .
what would be the advantages and disadvantages of a company completely of our own ?
you can run the company in whatever way you like and take all the risks as well as the profits .
i see .
the major disadvantage is that you have to provide all the financing and take all the risks , because the company is your own baby .
sounds like a lot of responsibilities . what about a joint venture ?
as the name suggests , a joint venture is a business with both chinese and foreign investment .
the two partners can bring to the venture capital funds , land , machinery , building , technology , labor , or any other things which may contribute to the venture .
i guess the foreign partner &apos;s investment will come mostly in the form of capital funds , machinery and technology .
right .
the chinese usually bring in land , building , labor and funds in renminbi , the chinese currency .
so compared with a solely-foreign-owned company , a joint venture imposes a much smaller financial burden on the foreign investor .
so i believer .
but , as both partners have investment , they both must have a say in the management of the venture .
correct .
both partners will have representatives on the board of directors and the management .
then i &apos;d imagine that it would be much more complicated to run a joint venture than a company of my own .
my answer is both yes and no .
because the board directors and managers come with different backgrounds , some misunderstandings and even conflicts are unavoidable , especially at the beginning .
but if both sides keep their mutual interests in mind and try their best to adjust to the new relationship , the venture may eventually benefit rather than suffer from such mixed management .
sounds interesting , but could you tell me why it may benefit rather than suffer ?
because the venture operates in china , the mixed management can appreciate this special environment better and therefore function better than an all foreigner management .
then they have discussed the other aspects of joint ventures .
i think you &apos;ve answered all my questions about joint ventures .
thank you very much , mr. li .
sure .
in effect , mr. bush , we are also looking for possibilities to set up a joint venture .
so i was wondering if you would be interested in becoming our partner .
surely i am .
i &apos;ll give your proposal serious consideration after this party and let you know as soon as i have something firm .
i &apos;ll do the same .
so keep in touch .
i will .
well , i think it &apos;s time to refill our glasses .
right .
i &apos;m here to ask about the movie projectors you wanted me to distribute to our outlets .
do you mean our new built-in projectors ?
that &apos;s right .
what &apos;s the price range ?
they start at around a hundred dollars and go up to a couple of hundred dollars for purchases of a dozen ?
are those prices fob or cif ?
they are fob .
well , i &apos;m thinking of ordering some ten or twenty dozen .
then , why don &apos;t you take a look at our family model ?
it &apos;s made especially for exporting and is priced at eighty-five dollars .
that sounds interesting .
let me see one .
mr. gao , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ?
as i said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . we hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
we &apos;re ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . i hope this concession of ours will set the ball rolling .
so do we .
i &apos;m afraid though , mr. hoffmann , that the ball can hardly roll very far .
certainly it &apos;s a step forward on your side . but the gap is still too wide .
the ball is with you , mr. gao . what price would you suggest ? step down as big as the one you &apos;ve just taken .
to make your offer workable , i think you should take another step down as big as the one you &apos;ve just taken .
that won &apos;t do .
you see , our profit margin is very narrow . it simply can &apos;t stand such a big cut .
i hate to disappoint you , mr. hoffmann , but if that &apos;s the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere .
do think it over , please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a success .
well , i &apos;m not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . would you mind waiting a day or two until i get a reply from the home office ?
not at all .
shall we meet again , say on friday , morning ?
good , friday morning at 9 .
we should be prudent when doing business , but you will also agree with me that we should not get overcautious .
you know willshire fashion . it &apos;s no longer the tiny company it was 20 years ago .
it is not due to financial difficulty that we ask for payment by d / a or d / p. h
ere is our annual report of last year .
you can see from this report that we enjoy a very solid financial standing .
mmm , your present standing is impressive , but a business firm &apos;s future is somewhat unpredictable , don &apos;t you agree ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t go along with you there so long as my company is concerned .
how can i convince you ?
well , if you still feel insecure , let me meet you half way and pay the first consignment by sight l / c and the second by sight d / p.
you will not lose a penny if you accept this arrangement , but it will save us a great deal .
well , please give me some time . i &apos;ll consult with my colleagues .
sure .
well , it &apos;s already 11 : 30 , and i &apos;m a bit hungry .
shall we adjourn for lunch now and resume the negotiation at two o &apos;clock this afternoon .
yes , i need to re-energize myself , too .
i realized the problem long time ago , and have considered various options .
the one which often comes to my mind recently is compensation trade .
i &apos;ve heard about it .
i need your help if it is to succeed .
i &apos;d be glad if i can be of any assistance , but i don &apos;t see how i can help .
you can supply us with machines and we &apos;ll compensate you with garments .
sounds good , but i wish we made those machines .
what i mean is you buy the machines for us and we &apos;ll give you garments as compensation .
oh i see .
well , it certainly sounds like a good idea to get around the hard currency problem , but there must be a lot of technical details i &apos;m not clear about .
i &apos;ve never done such trade before , you know .
neither have i.
but it seems to be the only solution we can think of at the moment .
and if it works out , you don &apos; t have to worry about our delivery any more .
i know it will do both of us good .
therefore i suggest that both of us give it serious consideration after this meeting .
at the moment , all we have to do is perhaps write a letter of intent .
good , what will it say ?
something like this .
in order to further their business relationship , both dafa garments and will hire fashion have expressed their interest in exploring the possibility of compensation trade .
yesterday , mr. bowen and mr. li reached a general agreement on the financial arrangement .
today , they are visiting the factories where the second-hand machines are located .
the first factory they visit is ralph &apos;s garments , a company owned by ralph moro , an american italian .
how old is this factory , mr. moro ?
almost ten years old .
how is the business ?
pretty good .
then why do you want to sell your machines ?
i want to sell the old machines only .
they are obsolete . require too much labor .
could you show them to us ?
come this way .
there are two cutting machines .
over there towards the far end of the wall , are ten hemming machines .
on their right are thirty-five sewing machines .
is that all ?
no .
down the aisle , in the connecting room , as i &apos;ll show you very soon , we have four steam pressing machines .
how long have these machines been in use ?
three to five years .
are they all worn out ?
oh no .
most of them are still in perfect shape , just need a lot of people to attend to .
could you give us demo ?
sure thing .
sophia . come here and show our guests how good our machines are .
i &apos;ve brought some sample materials with me today , mr. johnson .
good .
can i look at them ?
please do !
i &apos;d like to have your comments on some of these pieces .
you seem to have a little of everything here ; rayon , nylon , cotton , tetolon .
yes , there &apos;s quite an assortment .
what do you think about using this piece for clothing ?
clothing ?
do you mean heavy wear clothing ?
yes , bush jacket , children &apos;s school uniforms and so on .
te talon would be just the thing , i think .
and this piece , too .
that &apos;s one of the fibers , isn &apos;t it ?
this piece ?
there &apos;s some cotton in this . it looks like mixed staple and cotton .
soft to the touch , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , that &apos;s one of it &apos;s good points .
would you like to visit our factories ?
yes . that would be good . i can get the first-hand information .
i &apos;ll make the arrangement .
i hope you have a better understanding of our products and our company .
i hope so too .
thank you .
i represent the hessian trading company . we &apos;re interested in importing a complete bottling machine for exhibit and sale in our country .
if satisfactory we may consider further orders .
well , this unit here on display is a full scale assembly of our latest machine .
how do you think about it ?
very splendid .
how about patent rights ?
we have 5 international patents which we are ready to sell .
i can consider it .
do you have any literature i can take with me ?
yes , here are some catalogs and brochures .
how about the price list ?
here it is .
thanks . i &apos;ll contact you .
i have an appointment with mr. joho at 2 o &apos;clock .
may i have your name , please ?
my name is david andson . sales manager of the abc computer company .
he &apos;s waiting for you .
i &apos;ll show you to his office . please follow me .
thank you .
have a seat , please , mr. andson .
thank you .
these are some illustrations of the latest model computers .
our company is interested in medium-sized computers .
here are the medium-sized computers .
what do you think about them ?
they are very splendid .
what about the price ?
it costs 1,200 dollars per set . but if you buy one hundred sets , we &apos;ll give you a 10 percent discount .
i &apos;m here in taipei to inspect , obtain samples and , if possible , place some orders .
we have some samples in our showroom . this way , please .
thank you .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;m primarily interested in canned peaches .
we also need a lot of soft drinks , especially sweet ones .
as you know , our company has been exporting a lot of canned fruit juice .
we have canned peaches right over there .
they look very good .
can you quote on them ?
here &apos;s our quotation . the prices are fob keeling .
can you quote a cif price for me ?
certainly . please wait a moment .
thanks .
what &apos;s the type number ?
this one is a p-52 . here &apos;s an illustration .
thanks .
i can &apos;t decide on quantities until i see what you have and what i can take .
i have to keep within my budget .
if you &apos;re looking for up-to-date fixtures and appliances , this camera will interest you .
not this type .
i like a camera for its simplicity , not for its ornaments .
you have some more models here , i think .
yes .
for simple operations this is a good brand ; gives a perfect picture without much pre-arranging .
well , let me have a little time to work out quantities , then perhaps we can close a deal .
i &apos;ll take some of these pamphlets , if i may .
yes , please do .
we &apos;re ready to take a further consignment of your motorcycles .
these models are selling well .
but if you want a smaller engine , what about these models ?
yes , they &apos;re what we &apos;re looking for .
single-cylinder machines , perhaps low power , i would imagine .
they develop 4.5 horse-power at 9,000 rpm .
and the speed ?
maximum is 70 kilometers per hour .
well , as a lightweight they &apos;re good .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a demand for this type .
what &apos;s the model number ?
st-205 .
the main specifications are : single cylinder , 4 stroke engine , maximum horse-power 4.5 , and a speed of up to 70 kph .
what &apos;s the fuel consumption ?
at normal cruising speed it will get 90 km / per liter .
really ?
that &apos;s pretty good .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t place any definite orders with you just now . i will be asking you for quotations later on .
what are you particularly interested in ?
glues for veneers , plywood , interior woodwork such as panels and so on .
we produce some first-class materials for those industries .
recently , we extended one of our plants , and hope to open another one next year .
are much of your products going overseas ?
about sixty percent goes abroad .
that &apos;s good .
well , i have another engagement , so i shall have to make a move .
i &apos;m due in hong kong at ten o &apos;clock tomorrow morning .
well , thanks for calling . hope to see you again soon .
i &apos;ll call on you again , maybe next month .
good-bye .
it &apos;s very attractive copier . what &apos;s the power ?
oh , i see it &apos;s given here : 100 volts , ac : 20 amps .
the actual printing is done by a mercury quartz tube .
did you say it gives dry copies ?
yes .
do you have any shipping details ?
for example , size , weight , etc .
the shipping weight of this one is approximately 70 kgs .
is it ?
that &apos;s about 150 pounds , a little more perhaps .
shall i get some literature together for you ?
i wish you would .
i &apos;m sure we can do something with this model .
can you give me a rough idea of the price ?
prices to you would have to be worked out , either f.o.b. or c. i.f. prices .
what you see here ranges from us ＄ 850 to us ＄ 1,200 ex-factory .
i see .
i &apos;d like you to look through this new set of drawings , if you please .
certainly .
they &apos;re blueprints of the gauges you wrote us about .
that &apos;s right .
shall we go through the drawings together ?
well , briefly .
then i &apos;ll be in again to discuss manufacturing details , price , and delivery with you .
do you have any particulars about the specifications ?
no , i &apos;ll bring them next time .
let &apos;s take this print first .
yes .
this is a mini-type generator , no outside connections .
it &apos;s very convenient .
we can work on the two ways , portable and fixed , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , our draftsmen will prepare layouts for you , and work out an estimate for both types .
that &apos;s just what i want . let me have the information as soon as you can .
and the specifications ?
oh , yes , i &apos;ll bring them tomorrow morning .
mr. matthews , i &apos;ll give you this schedule .
this sheet covers the items we &apos;re likely to want about two months from now .
thank you .
orders will be placed later , i suppose .
that &apos;s right .
now , i think you could help us to widen our market if you &apos;d let us have more descriptive literature .
what kind of literature exactly ?
leaflets or book lets ?
booklets , preferably .
something up to say , 20 pages or so , illustrating microscope models suitable for use in college laboratories .
doesn &apos;t our present range of leaflets cover such models ?
it does , but only up to a point .
we would like to have more cuts and photos of specimen enlargements .
you know , the usual section cut giving the magnification .
the microscope model on one page , and representative subject enlargements on the facing page . is that what you mean ?
exactly .
perhaps we could arrange something for you . do you have any particular subjects in mind ?
i mean , study or research subjects .. biology , metallurgy ?
oh , the usual subjects in a college curriculum .
we &apos;re going to approach schools , research laboratories , and institutions of that kind .
we have an excellent line of microscope sets that would be suitable .
they include a range of interchangeable lenses , and small accessories .
yes , but they have a rather elaborate case .
i don &apos;t think schools taking say , one hundred , or even fifty microscopes would want the same number of cases in which to keep them .
possibly not .
but there would have to be some means of storing the lenses .
yes , i agree .
i was thinking that you could supply wooden boxes to hold the lenses and the accessories .
six to eight lenses to the set ; would that be about the number ?
well , what magnification would you recommend ?
what range , i mean .
for college courses i &apos;d recommend magnification ranging from 100 to 1,200. you could get that in suitable steps with eight lenses .
the technical part we &apos;ll leave to you . enquiries we &apos;ve had ate promising .
have you an approximate invoicing price in mind ?
i should say a typical set could be invoiced to the buyer for around 800 dollars .
by shipping in quantities we could manage that .
anyway , we &apos;ll try .
thank you .
i have a lot of new sketches ready for you , mr. wilson .
fine , thank you .
i &apos;d like to have a look at them .
certainly .
i &apos;ve got about twenty of them right here in this room , and many others in the artists room . let &apos;s start with those i &apos;ve got here .
o. k.
here you are .
what do you think of this one ?
not bad .
but , i think it would look better if this group of flowers were reduced , say , twenty percent .
i see . i &apos;ll note it down .
well , what about the next one ?
oh , this is quite similar to what i bought just a week ago .
is it really ?
i wish i could have shown ours to you two weeks earlier .
you may be right , mr. chang .
now , show me what you &apos;ve got next .
here you are .
this is interesting . i like the design , but the colors are a bit too heavy .
are they ?
we can make them lighter , if you like .
fine !
now , tell me , mr. chang , how long will it take to get the design re-colored ?
just give me a couple of days .
all right .
it &apos;ll look very nice if the colors are made softer .
i &apos;m sure it will .
shall i send it to your hotel as soon as it &apos;s ready ?
oh , that &apos;s very kind of you .
now , let &apos;s see the next .
yes , here it is .
how do you like it ?
this is the last one of the twenty . what do you think of our sketches generally ?
the designs are good . i &apos;ll probably take up several if the change in colors turns out satisfactory .
i &apos;m glad to hear that . and , i &apos;m sure our artists will do a good job .
by the way , mr. wilson , do you have an estimate about the trend in fashions ?
well , that &apos;s a very difficult question to answer .
you know , i am always looking for something new .
personally , i think the next fashion might be something warm in color .
oh , i see .
for instance , the color in this sketch ?
yes . but it &apos;s only my guess .
thank you , mr. wilson . it &apos;s a good advice .
i believe you know that we are going to take two or three of our tankers off the persian gulf run , either this year or next .
yes , you did send us some correspondence about that .
that &apos;s right , we did .
well , we &apos;re now able to go further into the question of replacements .
you haven &apos;t submitted any preliminary tenders , have you ?
not yet , but we gathered from your last letter that you intended to get bids from us .
yes .
there was some doubt about size of the replacements . however , we &apos;ve decided to go ahead with two ships in the 20 to 30-thousand ton class .
i see .
then would you like us to draw up general plans and specifications ?
yes , we would .
and for the purpose of bidding , you can quote for a 24,000 and a 26,000 . that &apos;s dead-weight tonnage in both cases .
i see .
and the propulsion method whether steam or diesel , you &apos;ll leave to us , i suppose ?
yes .
is there any distinct advantage in having one or the other ?
well , there are many factors to be taken into consideration in deciding which type you want .
which is the cheaper to run , the diesel or the steam ?
diesel is the more economical in fuel on a pound per horse power basis .
and it &apos;s lighter .
but diesel fuel is more expensive , surely .
it is , and that might offset the saving in fuel .
now comes the question of price .
can you indicate what budget you are prepared to allocate for the vessels ?
i can tell you that we are willing to go up to ＄ 180 per ton ; but terms of payment must be considered together with the price .
well , we can proceed on the basis of ＄ 180 .
shall we submit our tender to your hong kong office ?
yes . either direct or through your representative in hong kong .
who is your representative in hong kong now ?
you have a new man there , i believe .
yes , mr. kenneths .
i know your former representative , mr. parkson , very well . we often met in the street .
did you ?
mr. kenneths will be there for two years .
is that so ?
i &apos;ll call him when i am back in hong kong .
mr. lin of the china national light industrial products import and export corporation meets mr. john smith and mr. barry thompson , businessman and technician from the timex company of the u.s. to discuss manufacturing the timex mechanical watch in beijing .
hello , mr. smith , mr. thompson .
i trust you &apos;ve had a good rest .
yes , thank you .
mr. smith , mr. thompson , may i introduce to you mr. lin , our section chief ?
mr. lin , mr. thompson . mr. smith is the manager of far east trade department of timex &amp; co . mr. hompson is the engineer and designer of timex .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
glad to meet you , mr. lin .
glad to meet you too .
mr. lin has come to make sure that your stay in beijing is pleasant one .
why , thank you . you &apos;re going out of your way for us , i believe .
not at all .

if there &apos;s anything special you want , you can always tell the interpreter here .
thank you .
the room service here is quite good and we like the food .
i &apos;m glad you find the hotel service satisfactory .
yes , i do .
by the way , mr. smith and mr. thompson , mr. lin has a few things he &apos;d like to talk over with you .
by all means .
it &apos;s just the matter of the schedule , that is , if it is convenient for you flight now .
why not ?
no better time than now .
i understand that mr. watson your party has not arrived yet .
when do you expect him ?
he has booked his flight for the 14th .
i think we can draw up tentative plan now .
if mr. watson wants to make any changes , minor alterations can be made then . will that suit you ?
fine .
well . smith , i &apos;m sure mr. watson wouldn &apos;t mind a day of sightseeing as our hosts have taken all the trouble to arrange things .
well , in that case ..
mr. lin , were you thinking of any particular please you wanted be nice . we &apos;ve heard so much about it . how about it , smith ?
well , we had the summer palace in mind .
the summer residence of the empress dowager ?
that would be nice.we &apos;ve heard so much about it .
how about it , smith ?
sure , i &apos;m all for it now that you &apos;ve got me interested . but is there any way of ensuring we &apos;ll have enough time for our talks ?
well , so long as we know what each others requirements are and we don &apos;t get bogged down on details , i &apos;m sure the talks will progress as planned .
well , for our part , we &apos;ll do our best to make everything smooth sailing .
thank you . if all goes well we &apos;ll be able to wind up our talks the day after tomorrow .
i hope so . anyway we &apos;ll do our best .
the beijing office of geman lanjing corporation began its operation a month ago . to expand its business with china , mr. hutt , deputy general manager of beijing office , meets with mr. tang , manager of the china national technical import corporation , and enquires for the information regarding the did for a power engineering project .
mr. tang , it &apos;s a great pleasure for me to call on you today soon after i arrived at my post in beijing .
congratulations on your taking office in beijing . i wish you every success .
thank you .
i will do my best to promote business between us in the days to come .
so far , cooperation between our two corporations has been satisfactory . of course it will be further promoted in the future , i hope .
quite right .
that &apos;s the aim of our corporation and meanwhile my most important mission .
since china has pursued the socialist market economy , its foreign trade has been developing at a faster pace . our trade practice is more flexible than before .
i &apos;m sure you know all this , right ?
yes , i do . what &apos;s am very much interested in the new developments in china .
i &apos;ve heard that your company is prepared to call for a bid for a power engineering construction project in southeast china , is that true ?
yes , it is time to make arrangements now for invitation to be sent out .
you are well informed !
when do you intend to start the invitation to tender ?
we expect to send the tender invitations sometime next month .
what kind of equipment would you like to buy ?
the item we &apos;d like to buy is the advanced electric generator .
what &apos;s the time set for the bidders to submit their bids ?
the time period for bidding is temporarily set from 10th october to the end of october .
to whom will the bid the sent ?

mr. tang , i &apos;ve asked too much today , i &apos;m afraid .
that &apos;s all right .
you may contact mr. wu changbiao , our staff member for further detail , or talk to me directly , if you like .
fine .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s keep close touch with each other now and in the future .
mr. roberto puccini is manager of an italian machinery equipment company . the purpose of his current visit to china is to explore the possibilities of establishing a joint venture in china . director yu of a chinese wood processing factory meets with him .
yesterday we paid a visit to the imperial palace . it &apos;s really amazing that the chinese people have built such a great ancient palace . its architectural art is fantastic .
the imperial palace is also called &quot; forbidden city &quot; . its construction was begun in 1420 .
since then 24 ancient chinese emperors had lived there .
during the ming and qing dynasties many magnificent structures were built and perfected , therefore it deserves the title &quot; the excellent fruit of chinese traditional architectural art &quot; .
yes , it surely deserves the praise .
especially when i see the delicate designs engraved on the woodwork of the palace which has undergone several hundreds of years , i &apos;m thinking of joining hands with you to set up a wood plastic sheeting processing plant which would furnish china with the finest plastic sheeting used for the interior decoration .
it sounds a good idea .
besides , it coincides with our aspiration .
there is no doubt that we will make concerted effort to cooperate with you .
investors may enjoy preferential treatment for the establishment of a join venture in china .
oh ?
what preferential treatment can we get for a sino-foreign joint venture ?
according to the related laws and regulations of the chinese government , the preferential treatment provided to the investors is relatively attractive , as compared with that of other asian countries .
first of all , a join venture in china pays lower income tax , or even no income tax at all under certain conditions , during first five profit-making years .
the way i understand the profit-making year you mentioned is different from the year in which the plant is in operation , right ?
you are right .
what i mean is the year when the plant gets profits .
that &apos;s what i have thought ?
furthermore , you are allowed to remit your net profit , after having paid taxes , to your home countries and the part of the income tax on your net profit you paid already to the chinese government will be exempted from taxation at home as long as you have met the relative requirements .
that is the avoidance of double taxation .
it &apos;s encouraging . anyhow this is the first time for us to invest in china , we &apos;d like to be absolutely sure about our investment .
what concerns me is how long the advantage of paying lower tax would last .
please don &apos;t worry about it . the chinese policy of opening to the outside world will remain stable for a long period , for it has been incorporated into the chinese constitution .
thus i can rest assured of it .
china &apos;s political situation is stable and the policy of opening-up is firm , our country now provides an excellent investment environment .
specifically speaking , china is a big country with a large population , rich resource and a comparatively low level of wages and material cost . all these are apparently favourable conditions for direct investment .
china also needs to import advanced equipment and technology so as to improve the product quality production efficiency .
and the chinese party usually brings in land , building , labour and funds in renminbi , the chinese currency . so compared with a wholly-foreign-owned company , a joint venture imposes a much smaller financial burden on the foreign investor .
so we have vast potentials for cooperation between us .
i &apos;d like to know how profits and risks the joint venture .
it depends upon which form the joint venture takes .
basically there are two types of joint venture : equity joint venture and contractual joint venture .
what &apos;s the difference between them ?
in an equity joint venture , the profits and risks are shared according to the partners &apos; shares of equity in that venture .
the bigger the share , the greater the profits and risks the partner will have .
then how are the profits and risks shared in the contractual joint venture ?
in a contractual joint venture , everything is stipulated in a contract , so is the proportion of profits each partner is entitled to .
i see .
could you tell me the details about establishing and running a joint venture ?
what do you mean ?
for instance , is there any regulation regarding the foreign party &apos;s share in the registered capital ?
the relative regulations are rather flexible . generally speaking , in a joint venture , the proportion of investment by the foreign investors should not be less than 25 % , but there isn &apos;t an upper limit .
thanks .
how long is the duration of a joint venture ?
no rigid rules , either .
we may temporarily set a 15-year period for a joint venture like the wood plastic sheeting processing plant .
the contract could be extended if both sides agree , so long as we can run the plant well .
how should we diced the administrative responsibilities of a joint venture ?
the joint venture will be run under the guidance of the board of directors . according to the relevant regulations and laws . the number of directors as well as rights and responsibilities representing a party should be determined on the basis of the investment that particular party has made in the business .
it sounds rather reasonable .
managing directors and managers will be nominated and agreed upon by both parties through consultations .
their term of office is four years . they could be dismissed and replaced if anyone of them is proved to be unqualified .
thank you very much .
you have certainly enlightened me quite a lot about establishing a joint venture in china .
i &apos;ll bring this matter up an hold a discussion with my company &apos;s management on the joint venture proposition as soon as i return home .
i &apos;ll let you know directly when we have something firm .
i shall look forward to hearing from you soon .
good .
i hope that through our joint efforts you will go back home with a new contract , just as you did in all your
so do i.
terrific .
now let &apos;s get down to business .
your fax of june 2 says you want to buy blouses from us .
that &apos;s correct .
here are the designs .
thank you .
we certainly welcome this opportunity to further our relationship .
now , how shall we proceed ?
we &apos;re here at your disposal .
well , as we both have expressed satisfaction at our previous contract , may i suggest that it be the basis of the new contract ?
this will simplify the matter a great deal .
that might be a good idea , but the market situation has somewhat changed since we signed the previous contract last july .
at that time , the us economy was not as bad as it is today and people still had a lot of discretionary money to spend .
according to the latest forecast by the us consumer association , however , the recession will get worse before the economy gets better .
as a result , the us consumers will remain tight fisted if the price stays on the same level .
your point is well taken , mr. bowen , and people will spend less when their wallets get flatter .
but that applies mostly to luxurious items such as cars and fashions .
what you want to buy from us are blouses , a common necessity , just like food . as we all know , goods of necessity are inelastic .
in other words , whatever the prices , people will just have to buy them .
well put , mr. li , as far as the theory is concerned .
but i &apos;m afraid the price of blouses is not entirely inelastic .
too high a price will certainly force people to buy fewer blouses , particularly in a recession like this .
but the price of our blouses is never too high .
as a matter of fact , they are the most competitive in your market .
well , what should i say ?
i only hope they will remain competitive and affordable to our customers .
that &apos;s for sure .
i &apos;ve told you that we were already in a tight corner and couldn &apos;t move any more .
look , mr. bowen . if we had thought of our own interest only , we wouldn &apos;t have accepted the terms of payment you proposed .
right ?
yes .
we took the risk nevertheless because we felt that our relationship can &apos;t develop can &apos;t develop without mutual understanding and mutual concessions .
so , i hope you will treat this price issue in the same spirit .
all right .
let me make it $ 14.90 .
frankly , i doubt if we can make any profit at this price .
mr. bowen , you needn &apos;t be so pessimistic . even at $ 15.90 , you can still make reasonable profit .
you must be kicking , mr. li .
i &apos;m serious , $ 15.90 . that &apos;s my rock bottom price . i can &apos;t sell our blouses under their real value .
$ 14.90 , i can &apos;t go any further .
there is an embarrassing silence .
well , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time for a break ?
right !
we all need a good stretch .
what do you say to their suggestion , mr. bowen ?
i &apos;m afraid they are right .
let &apos;s take a break .
well , what should we do ?
i really can &apos;t commit myself if the total payment for the machinery is too big .
but before we see the factories , how can we know how much the total payment is ?
perhaps we should go to the factories first .
no , i &apos;d rather go there with a definite idea about the financial arrangement .
i don &apos;t want to waste my time bargaining without knowing where the money will come from .
all right . i &apos;ve got an idea .
yes ?
let &apos;s set an upper limit for the financing you &apos;re going to provide .
and dafa garments will take care of the balance if the total payment exceeds that limit .
what do you say to that ?
that seems to be a reasonable idea .
let me see . what about $ 200,000 ?
i &apos;m afraid we need more than that .
at least $ 300,000 .
remember you have to pay interest for that .
i know .
all right , $ 300,000 .
thank you very much , mr. bowen .
i hope we won &apos;t have to spend all of it .
so do i.
well , shall we take a break ?
i could do with a cup of coffee . what would you like , coffee or tea ?
tea , please .
having spent a wonderful weekend , mr. li and mr. yang are back at willshire fashion .
in front of you is the draft for the formal agreement on the compensation trade package .
it is based on my contract with ho &apos;s clothing and our agreement on the financial arrangement .
would you please read it over first ?
thank you , mr. bowen .
it &apos;s a very good draft , on the whole , that is .
thank you , but if you have any questions , or want to make any change in the wording and phrasing , please feel free to let me know .
i will .
in fact , i do have a couple of points i &apos;d like to discuss with you .
good , fire away .
first of all , the financial arrangement .
perhaps you still remember the counter guarantee i proposed last wednesday .
yes , you asked me to guarantee that by the time your issuance l / c is due , the accumulative value of our purchase from you should be the same as the value of your l / c.
that &apos;s right .
but all i can promise at the moment is that we &apos;ll do our best in purchasing from you .
that &apos;s not a guarantee .
but what else can i do ?
have you come up with a more practical idea ?
yes .
earlier , you asked me to open a 180-day issuance l / c , right ?
yes .

an egyptian foodstuffs company imports mutton from china regularly . owing to the shortage of foreign exchange , mr. salah masen , manager of the import department , is sent to china to explore the possibility of doing barter trade . mr. gui , deputy manager of export department of the china foodstuffs corporation meets with him .
mr. masen , in honour of your second visit , i &apos;d like to invite you to have &quot; shuan yangrou &quot; at dong-lai-shun restaurant this evening , you know it is instant-boiled mutton .
thank you .
&quot; shuan yangrou &quot; of dong-lai-shun is world renowned i know .
you are very kind to invite me to a dinner party .
but i have a headache at the thought of eating mutton .
why ?
i say a headache because the prospects for importing mutton from china are not so encouraging . we are short of foreign exchange this year .
oh ! what a pity !
please , don &apos;t be worry about it .
as i see it , egypt is a big market for the export of our beef and mutton . apparently , it would also be a loss for us , if you don &apos;t import mutton and beef . we might be able to work out a solution .
yes . the purpose of my present visit here is to solve this problem .
could you accept barter trade ?
yes , we &apos;ll see what we can do .
but what commodity do you have to exchange for our beef and mutton ?
what about cotton ?
china used to import large quantities of cotton from egypt every year . is it acceptable for us to sell cotton as payment for your beef and mutton ?
oh , my dear friend , please don &apos;t forget that we are both dealers in foodstuffs .
it doesn &apos;t matter to us .
we deal in a great variety of items .
what about you ?
but we have never imported cotton before .
we need to consult the other department of our corporation if you decide to barter with cotton .
please do that as soon as possible .
i tell you , the total import of beef and mutton roughly would equal your purchase of cotton , though the import and export trade will be carried out separately .
anyhow , it &apos;s relatively difficult to do business in this manner .
we &apos;re not sure whether we could simultaneously sign two contracts , that is , one sales contract for beef and mutton , and the other contract of equal value for the purchase of cotton .
i do not mean the same day by &quot; simultaneously &quot; .
the time limitation may not be so strict . i think it is quite all right , so far as it &apos;s within one month or two .
that means import and export can be done separately , one may be earlier or later than the other by one or two months .
precisely .
how would both parties open their letters of credit ?
the letters of credit could be opened against each other . it &apos;s also possible that one could be opened before or after the other .
if one l / c should be opened before the other , is the party who fist opens the l / c taking some risks ?
there &apos;s no risk at all . he , who opens l / c first , may state in his l / c that the said l / c comes into force only when an l / c with approximately the same value from the counter-party is established with a tolerance of plus or minus 5 % .
i see , that arrangement ensures the obligation of the other party to buy .
anyhow , you may rest assured that we &apos;ll not go back on our words .
i do believe that you will carry out your promise .
this arrangement helps implement the principle of equality and mutual benefit and exchange of needed goods .
yes , that is true .
the problem of your shortage of foreign exchange can be resolved while the urgent requirements of both sides can be met .
let me contact them right now . i &apos;ll ask them to consider our proposition of barter trade .
in a day or two , i &apos;ll to consider our proposition of barter trade . in a day or two , i &apos;ll call you up to meet again here and finalize the transaction .
last time we sere talking about the establishment of a joint venture to produce the wooden plastic sheeting . through consultation with my company , we &apos;d like to establish an equity joint venture .
each of the two sides will put in a certain portion of the capital and share profits or losses in proportion to their respective contributions .
a good idea . it coincides with my aspiration .
how much of a financial outlay is needed ?
about five million us dollars including loans .
how much would you like to invest in this project , anyway ?
as the general practice , we lay out about 51 % of the total investment . this includes land , building , labour and funds in renminbi , the chinese currency .
what regulations does chinese government have on the foreign proportion of investment ?
the foreign investment proportion shall be no less than 25 % .
then our capital contribution will include production equipment , testing instruments and technology .
at the beginning we may import one set of production line we can expand it in time later .
very good . now let &apos;s talk about the duration of the joint venture .
how long can we run it ?
let &apos;s set it for 20 years for the time being .
the contract could be extended if both sides agree .
that &apos;s fine . there &apos;s also another question of the composition of the board of directors .
usually its composition will be in proportion to the capital contributed .
what about the term off office the directors ?
as usual , it &apos;s set for a four-year term .
we are working on the feasibility study now .
it &apos;ll be sent you directly when it &apos;s finished .
all right .
yang and the americans get off the lift and help the porter get the baggage into their rooms .
superb ! a home away from home , as the saying goes .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
well , if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to discuss the itinerary with you .
not at all .
good .
here are some copies of the tentative itinerary we drafted for you . let &apos;s go over it . please feel free to make changes wherever you feel necessary .
okay .
you &apos;ll stay in china for six days , the first four days in beijing , and the rest in guangzhou .
good .
as you need a day or two to get over jetlag , you &apos;ll have a light schedule for today and tomorrow .
in fact , nothing is fixed up for you this afternoon .
you could either stay in the hotel for a good rest , or go out for sightseeing . which do you prefer ?
if you want to go sightseeing , i &apos;d be glad to be your guide .
i &apos;d like to go out , but someone wants to interview me during our visit .
here is his card .
wang dawei , correspondent , china daily .
right . i met this mr. wang last month in washington , d.c.
he was interested in our business with china and wanted to write a report on it .
i take this as an excellent opportunity to publicize our corporation .
so i &apos;d appreciate it very much if you would help me arrange this interview .
mr. wang &apos;s address and phone number are on his card , aren &apos;t they ?
yes .
i &apos;ll call him as soon as we finalize the itinerary .
thank you , mr. yang .
yesterday , the americans had a great time atop the tiananmen gate and enjoyed the beijing opera show tremendously .
at 9 : 00 this morning , they come to dafa garments for formal negotiations .
after exchanging greetings with mr. li , mr. yang and another chinese , they take seats .
mr. bowen , did you have a good time yesterday ?
oh , yes .
we got on the tiananmen gate and had a great time up there .
good !
how about you , mr. dewey ?
have you enjoyed your first visit to china ?
oh yes .
i &apos;ve enjoyed every minute and everything of it : the tiananmen gate the forbidden city , the chinese food and the beijing opera . everything !
i &apos;m glad you both have had a good time .
but , have you got anything to complain about ?
no .
it couldn &apos;t be better .
well , i &apos;ve got only one thing to complain about .
that is , we &apos;re a bit spoiled by your hospitality , i &apos;m afraid .
all laugh .
honestly , we &apos;ve got nothing to complain about .
very good .
have you both got over the jet-lag ?
thanks to your thoughtful arrangement , i feel much better now .
me , too .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
well , since you both have had a good time and no longer suffer from the jet-lag , maybe it &apos;s time to take business now .
i think so .
the negotiation resumes in the afternoon .
good afternoon , mr. bowen .
i &apos;ve got good news for you .
yes ?
we agree to accept the terms of payment you proposed this morning .
thank you so much , mr. li .
we accept your proposal with an eye on our future relationship . we believe that our relationship cannot last long without mutual understanding and mutual concessions .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
we &apos;ve reached an agreement on payment in this spirit .
i hope this spirit will guide us in solving all the other problems .
so do i.
very good .
well , speaking of other problems , maybe it &apos;s time to go back to the issue of price .
okay .
perhaps we need a quick review of what we &apos;ve gone through so far .
our offer was $ 16.80 each blouse , and you counter-offered $ 14.40 . we .
i &apos;m sorry , but our first counteroffer was $ 13.50 , the price we paid for the filipino blouses .
well , if that was your first counteroffer , then you increased it to $ 14.40
that &apos;s a 7 % increase .
okay .
then we responded by cutting our offer also by 90 cents and made it $ 15.90 .
so the next step , naturally , should be taken by you .
how did you find that last lot of marmalade ？
oh , excellent .
but one or two buyers said the marmalade might be little too sweet .
i see .
and the canned peaches , what about them ?
ah , that &apos;s a different story .
the taste of the peaches is fine ; but as you know , appearance counts in canned foods .
without any doubt , appearance comes before price .
how could the canned peaches be improved ?
i recommend a pleasant color and no mess .
where &apos;s the mess , exactly ?
in the syrup , or in the peach halves ?
customers have told me that hollow of the peach halves , you know , the inside of the peach , should be clean cut that is to say , no fibers or pulp remaining .
do you find competition severe these days ?
it &apos;s more severe than it was , say , this time last year .
in what way ?
price ? advertising ?
well , some of the newcomers have put on attractive exhibitions in various cities throughout the country . that gives them a sudden spurt in sales .
you &apos;re expanding your plant . i hear .
yes .
our new factory will start production sometime to wards the end of this month . that &apos;ll help with deliveries .
really ?
i hope you &apos;ll open another one after that .
thanks .
sales are going up year by year . we &apos;ll have to expand to keep up with demand .
the next step might be opening a factory abroad .
well , that &apos;s possible .
we &apos;ve been considering that .
then your delivery problems will fade out .
what can you offer to compete with some of the new models we see on the market nowadays ?
we &apos;ve got these lines .
they &apos;re much in demand just now . all of them have new features .
well , your terms , by the way , are they down payment , or since payment ?
we ask that your payment should be by the term of letter of credit .
i see , and delivery ?
can you supply fairly promptly ?
yes . just now we are quoting one month from receipt of order .
you can &apos;t supply from stock , then .
in some lines we can . for example , accessories .
i see .
i will go through this folder when i get back to the hotel .
before i leave here , i shall probably be able to place a modest-sized order with you .
thank you .
we shall be pleased to attend to it .
what kind of document is an invoice ?
it &apos;s mailed to a buyer by the seller and contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , for warding particulars , and terms of payment .
i know there are several kinds of invoices . can you explain them to me ?
all right .
there are four main kinds of foreign invoices . they are loco invoice , f.o.b. invoice , c. i.f. invoice , and franco invoice .
the most commonly used are f.o.b. and c. i.f. invoices , right ?
right .
loco invoice is one in which the price charged includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . other expenses are paid by the buyer .
by c. i.f. invoice the price charged includes all the expenses of an f.o.b. invoice plus freight and marine insurance .
all expenses to destination are included in the price in a franco invoice .
hello , mr. black . you &apos;ve come at a good time . we &apos;ve just got our latest products all nicely set out in this new catalog .
good . i &apos;d like to look through it .
please , take this copy .
you &apos;ve ordering for the christmas trade , i suppose .
yes .
meanwhile , we &apos;ll place an order , too .
thank you .
there &apos;s a fine range here in this book .
i &apos;ll show you the actual toys , of course , but suppose we glance through a few pages of the catalog first .
that &apos;s a good idea . i &apos;d like to see your latest models .
here they are in the first section of the catalog .
oh , yes , mechanical toys . they &apos;re good sellers at any time .
trains , fork-lifts , monorails , space ships ; they &apos;ve got all the features that will appeal to youngsters .
what is the motion power of the toys on this page ?
mainly clockwork . the electrically operated are in the next section .
well , we can take a fairly big supply of clockwork types again this year .
what are these ?
electromechanical toys .
they have dry cell batteries , i suppose .
yes .
do you have anything in the remote control line ?
yes , i &apos;ll show you some .
here . all these on this page are activated by a remote control system .
i see .
fine-looking sets they are , too . we will have to take such things , although i &apos;m not too keen on complicated mechanisms .
is there any particular line or design you would like us to prepare for you ?
no .
we &apos;re ready to take anything that &apos;s new . something with a freshness about it .
do you have any suggestions or comments to make about our doll and animal lines ?
comments ?
let me see .
we &apos;ve heard parents comment unfavorably about long-haired toy animals .
about their becoming easily soiled and unsanitary , perhaps .
yes .
others want fillings that won &apos;t spill when the animals or dolls get punctured .
well , rubber and plastics are doing away with fillings , of course .
i suppose so .
by the way , how &apos;s the letter of credit allocation working out ?
is it sufficient for the shipments you &apos;ve been making ?
yes .
we draw a supplementary . d / p draft if necessary .
your head office suggested that as a means of covering the excess in any shipment .
mr. smith , it &apos;s true the complete plant we intend to buy is not small , but i &apos;m afraid you are too modest when you say it is beyond the financial capability of your corp .
everybody knows that yours is one of the largest and most famous transnational corporations in the world , and has more than 30 branches in over ten countries . it is nothing to you at all to finance the manufacture of the complete plant we plan to buy .
but you should understand , mr. zhang , a branch of the trans-national corporation does not mean the corporation itself .
each branch is independent with regard to finance and accounting .
of course , this does not mean no financial help between the head office and the branches exists .
however , this has to be approved by the highest authority of the trans-national corporation-the board of directors .
they can authorize the necessary aid to a branch .
i can understand that the branches of a transnational corporation should be independent in their financing and accounting .
although all of them are socialist in ownership , each branch or unit within the associated enterprise is also independent in finance and responsible for its own financial gain or loss . we are well aware that there will be no financial problem at all if your branch manufactures the complete plant single-handedly . besides , if necessary , you could still get financial aid from the head office . i &apos;m sure that the board of the directors will give favourable consideration to authorizing financial help to your branch when they are told your branch is doing business with china .
oh , that &apos;s true , i think .
but you see , even if our head office gives our branch any financial aid , interest has to be paid just the same . it &apos;s like a loan from a commercial bank . so , in that case , our own money would be tied up in your plant while we had to pay interest to the head office for the money borrowed form them .
mr. smith , i would like to remind you that we took into consideration the factor of deferred when we cabled you our acceptance of your final offer . that means , the present price agreed upon by our two parties is a bit higher than that for the normal payment terms .
but we did not expect the payment to be effected after actually receiving the shipment . it &apos;s even more unfavourable to us than the d / p terms , and besides , we haven &apos;t any baker &apos;s guarantee .
as to the guarantee of a bank , we may ask for a guarantee from the bank of china . do you have any specific proposal in mind ?
yes .
i propose that payment should be made by instalments , that is , after each shipment , we will send you the b / l and other necessary documents through our bank and yours-the bank of china .
as long as the documents are in order you should effect payment without delay . in order to ensure payment , the bank of china should hand us a written letter to the effect that they will guarantee the payment if the buyer fails to do so .
the bank of china can either give one letter of guarantee for the whole transaction , or give separate letters of guarantee for separate instalments . either way , the letter of guarantee should reach us two months before shipment is due , as stipulated in the contract .
i don &apos;t intend to make an on-the-spot comment on your proposal .
we should study it first , and also consult the band of china .
but my preliminary impression is that it looks as if the mode of payment is d / p , but in fact it is no different from l / c payment , except that it changes an l / c to a bank &apos;s guarantee . it would be in a way more favourable to the seller , because a bank &apos;s letter of guarantee gives him the bank &apos;s direct assurance for the payment while an l / c is opened by the bank only at the request of the opener and also gives a kind of assurance but not so direct . am i right ?
you may understand it in that way , but a letter of guarantee won &apos;t require you to deposit the money in the bank .
i &apos;m afraid , the cost one should pay to me bank for the letter of guarantee would surely be no less than the interest he can get from the money he is required to deposit in the bank .
we must think it over carefully and make certain calculations regarding your proposal and then give you an answer .
could you come again the day after tomorrow ?
the day after tomorrow , that &apos;ll be friday . o.k. , i &apos;ll be here again at 10 : 00 a.m.
alright . see you again .
is there anything else we need to go over ?
i &apos;ve got a couple of more things in the new catalog to show you .
o.k.
i think we need a break , though .
me , too .
let &apos;s go out for lunch .
right .
it &apos;s been a long session .
well , that just about wrapping the whole thing up .
yes . it &apos;s been a good meeting .
you can say that again .
we &apos;re really glad you could come .
do you have time for lunch with me ?
sure .
let &apos;s go right now before something else comes up .
mr. li has a good friend , mr. wang , at the commercial section of the chinese consulate at los angeles .
he decides to give him a ring .
chinese consulate .
may i speak to mr. wang shan , please .
speaking .
hi , lao wang . li kang here .
li kang ?
where in the hell are you ?
here in la for business .
that &apos;s great .
how long are you going to stay ?
about a week .
terrific .
we must talk .
oh tell you what . there will be a cocktail party here at the consulate on monday evening .
you must come .
i &apos;d love to , but what &apos;s the party for ?
we &apos;ve invited about fifty american business people who have been doing or are interested in doing business with china .
sounds like a good opportunity for new business possibilities .
you bet .
the party will start at 6 : 30 .
come a bit earlier so that we can have a little chat of our own .
a good idea .
is six o &apos;clock a bit too early ?
not at all .
then see you at six o &apos;clock monday evening .
see you then .
there are some minor details i &apos;d like to mention .
yes ?
we think you &apos;d like to taste some beijing duck while you &apos;re in beijing .
oh , that would be great !
then we &apos;ll have dinner together on the evening of the 14th , that is the evening of mr. watson &apos;s arrival .
and would you be interested in beijing opera ?
i wouldn &apos;t mind taking in some beijing opera .
would you , smith ?
no , i &apos;d like it .
but i hear it is hard to understand .
thanks . so our evenings will be quite full then ?
thanks.so our evenings will be quite full then ?
oh , no , we &apos;ll leave some evenings free , that is , if it &apos;s all right with you .
oh , sure , that &apos;s what i wanted to suggest . we &apos;d have to compare notes on what we &apos;ve discussed during the day .
right . let &apos;s see what we can work out .
is there anything special you &apos;d like to do ?
there is , if it can be arranged .
yes ?
we &apos;d like to see a couple of your watch factories .
that can be easily arranged .
anything else ?
but if it is not too much trouble , we would like to talk to some of the technicians , if this is possible .
that could be done when you visit be factories .
good !
we &apos;ll take it , then , that the day after mr. watson arrives , we &apos;ll have a briefing session , so you &apos;ll know what we need and we &apos;ll know what you have to offer.will that do ?
sure . that &apos;ll put us both in the picture .
the day after that-should we continue with our talks or would you .
look , couldn &apos;t you arrange a visit to one of your factories on that day ?
then we &apos;d have some idea of what you &apos;ll be needing .
i can &apos;t say for certain off-hand . but i think it can be arranged for mr. watson to visit the beijing watch factory in the afternoon , that is , if it &apos;s convenient for you .
that &apos;s ideal !
better have something we can get our hands on rather than just spend all our time talking .
and after that we &apos;ll continue with our talks . you &apos;ll have some first hand knowledge of the situation by then .
yes , it &apos;ll be easier for us to get down to facts then .
we &apos;ll be having talks for a couple of days . i believe , there &apos;re a lot of things to go over .
we thought you might like to see the sights of beijing between talks .
thanks , maybe later .
let &apos;s get business over first .
well , we had thought a sightseeing trip between talks would be a welcome diversion .
business can be combined with pleasure , you know .
of course . i &apos;d appreciate it , if you &apos;ll arrange it .
all right . then i believe that &apos;s settled .
by the way , mr. lin , can you recommend a good restaurant ? we &apos;d like to give dinner for you too .
thank you . when the time comes , i &apos;ll ask the interpreter to make the necessary reservations for you .
thanks .
and would you please see that our plane tickets are booked for tuesday , the day after we wind up our talks .
sure .
but wouldn &apos;t you like to spend an extra day or two in beijing ?
i &apos;m afraid that won &apos;t be possible , much as we &apos;d like to . you see , we &apos;ve got to report back to the head office .
oh , i see . maybe some other time then .
we &apos;re sure we &apos;ll be in and out of beijing pretty often in future .
then it &apos;s all settled .
thank you for your cooperation .
i &apos;m sure the talks will go well .
we &apos;ve arranged our schedule without any trouble .
next , let &apos;s get down to business .
as the supply of the metal is quite tight , .
excuse me . i can &apos;t follow you .
could you speak slowly , please ?
of course . as the supply of the metal is quite tight . am i speaking slowly enough ?
yes . thank you .
i &apos;d like to apply for a secretarial position .
very well . do you know any shorthand ?
no , but i can write very fast .
can you use a computer and other office machines ?
no , but i &apos;d be glad to learn how to use them .
this is a permanent position . can you work every day from nine to five ?
oh , no .
i &apos;m a student at the university and i have to study most of the time . i can only work part-time .
i &apos;m sorry . i couldn &apos;t possibly hire you .
good ! what salary do you expect ?
how about hk $ 2,500 a month ?
i &apos;m prepared to pay you hk $ 3,000 a month during the probation period .
after that , your salary can be increased . but it depends on how well you work .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s very generous . what about holidays ?
you will have 11 holidays with pay each year besides the chinese general holidays .
that sounds wonderful .
shall i sign a contract now ?
not now . after the probation , we can talk about that .
come in , please .
good morning , mr. white .
good morning , mary . sit down , please .
thank you .
have you ever worked as a secretary before ?
yes , i was secretary in a joint-venture company two months ago .
can you speak english ?

by the way , my major is chinese .

how about tomorrow morning ?
all right . i hope we &apos;ll enjoy our cooperation .
goodbye !
let me show you how our filing system works .
what will i have to do with these ?
you are responsible for keeping all these files in order .
i see .
where can i find additional folders if i need them ?
over here , this is where we keep office supplies .
fine . will i be taking care of supplies too ?
yes. one of your monthly duties will be take an inventory of stock on hand and place orders for those items in low supply .
mr. ando , since there isn &apos;t much else to do today , would you go through the database and update it ?
what exactly would you like me to do , sir ?
delete all the inactive records from the &quot; customers &quot; file .
yes , sir .
if i am not mistaken , all the inactive records are those marked with a star . is that correct ?
darn !
this computer isn &apos;t working right .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i just can &apos;t get it started .
but that &apos;s a brand-new computer . it shouldn &apos;t be out of order so soon .
judie , can i see you in my office for a minute ?
anything important ?
we need to work overtime tonight . these have to go out first thing in the morning .
well but it is friday today . i was planning on taking my son to an exhibition this evening .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is urgent and you &apos;ll be earning overtime money .
well , if i have to take it .
thanks , judie .
well , i don &apos;t know how to explain this , but ..
come on !
i &apos;m listening .
i. , i think i &apos;ve been underpaid . i believe i deserve a higher salary .
oh ?
tell me how much do you think you are worth ?
thirty dollars a week more .
when was the last time you got a raise ?
six months ago sir .
sorry . it must be an oversight .
i &apos;ll give you a thirty-dollar raise starting next week , thank you for reminding me .
wow , thank you so much !
this couldn &apos;t be better .
thanks a lot mr. brown !
what would you like me to do with today &apos;s mail , ma &apos;am ?
please bring it to me now , i have been waiting for some important information .
here it is . personal mail is in the first bundle , bills in the second and receipts in the third .
i have opened all the envelopes except the personal mail .
fine . thank you .
weren &apos;t there any orders today ?
yes ma &apos;am . i have already forwarded them to the mailroom .
very good . that will be all for now .
i &apos;ll call you if i need anything else ?
i &apos;ve just finished placing all those telephone calls you requested . what would you like me to do next ?
have you finished taking care of those contract agreements ?
the documents you requested have already been collated and sent over to the finance director .
fine , that takes care of everything for the moment .
then , if there &apos;s nothing else you would like me to do , could i take my lunch break a little early today ?
i &apos;m planning to sort last year &apos;s receipts before closing time .
yes , go ahead .
have mr. nogami watch your desk for you until you get back .
miss sugishita , the regular keyboard operator , mrs. ae , is absent today . so i want you to type this sales data into the profits spreadsheet on the computer .
do it like this .
yes sir . i see .
why do all the numbers below the dotted line change each time you put a new number in at the top ?
the numbers at the bottom show the profits calculated from the data at the top .
the net profit figure in this cell is calculated by a formula that subtracts the costs in this cell from the gross profit in this cell .
so then a spreadsheet is like a huge calculation sheet .
the value entered into one cell affects all the other values in cells related to it .
is that correct ?
yes , that is why you must be very careful when you enter data .
one mistake will throw all the other calculations off .
would you like me to send that letter as electronic mail ?
do you think that would be faster than express delivery postal mail ?
certainly . i &apos;ll word process it , save it as a file , then load that file into the telecommunications program to transfer to his computer .
that way , he &apos;ll have it by noon .
fine . by the way , what do you think we should do about translating those conference materials for the foreign participants ?
after i upload the letter . shall i put a message on the telecommunications bulletin board requesting a translator experienced in automotive research translation ?
yes , please do .
excuse me , can you tell me something about your work schedule ?
sure .
what time do you usually leave home for work jack ?
my company starts to work at 9 : 00 and i go to work at 8 : 30 .

what time will you be at lunch ?

i &apos;ll read these , but i &apos;d like to get in touch with my office in the states first .
fine .
mr. wrigley , if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to know how you feel about our products , compared with others in taiwan .
i feel that your designs aren &apos;t very eye-catching , but your quality is the best i have seen so far .
i &apos;m happy to hear about the quality , and i can tell you we &apos;re working on a whole new look for our products . i
i really hope we can do business with you , mr. wrigley .

mr. cordon house , a general importer &amp; exporter , form canada comes to qingdao for business talks on purchasing silks at the invitation of qingdao foreign trade corporation .
he is staying at the haitian hotel and expecting mr. xu , a department manager of the cooperation to talk about the schedule for his business visit .
come on in , please .
i am sure you must be mr. xu from the foreign trade corporation , right ?
yes , i am .
i hope i am not later for our appointment .
no , not at all .
i was expecting you . please sit down .
would you like to try a cup of canadian bag-tea ?
thank you .
i &apos;ve come to make sure that your stay in qingdao is a pleasant one .
why , thank you .
i am sure i &apos;ll have a good time here in qingdao with our careful arrangement .
haitian is equipped with modern comforts and conveniences .
the view of the sea is beautiful and the food is very tasty . i like most of the food except the seacucumber .
you mean you &apos;re a seafood lover ?
as many visitors might expect , qingdao &apos;s culinary specialties revolve around seafood .
i believe you &apos;ll know this city better and try come food .
and we &apos;ll keep you busy for the coming days .
that is why i &apos;m here to meet you this afternoon .
you be , mr. xu .
you know my schedule is very tight , but i &apos;d like to see more of this beautiful city , for i find that it is much like vancouver , my hometown .
mr. house , we have made a tentative program for your visit . i hope it suits you .
i &apos;d like to have your idea .
but if there &apos;s anything unsuitable to you , do let me know .
here it is .
. dinner with mr. zhang and xu at the pearl restaurant this evening . discussion on market access tomorrow . see the silk samples this afternoon . peking opera at people &apos;s theater . dinner party . talk on terms of payment . shipment . dinner again . oh , my goodness , it seems that i will be spoiled by you people .
anyway , it &apos;s a well-organized program .
i appreciate everything you &apos;re doing for me , especially the peking opera .
i heard that type of opera is your national opera .
many canadian-chinese like it very much .
only one thing ， if you don &apos;t mind , i have to suggest that i need a guided tour to laoshan , for i was told that it is not only a scenic mountain but also a place famous for taoism . it would be nice if you could make a tour to that place possible .
sure , no problem at all , mr. house .
it is only a tentative plan . we may make any changes as we like .
what about making it on tuesday ?
yes , tuesday is a good time .
i &apos;ll remember that .
and we have left some afternoons free for you to see the sights of qingdao between talks .
that &apos;s great .
you are very considerate , mr. xu .
the plan fits in nicely with mine .
you see , i &apos;m a total stranger here . i suppose the safest way is to put myself in your hands .
thank you for saying so .
one more thing for you , mr. house . a school in qingdao wants to invite you to give a talk on international salesmanship to students majoring in international business because some of the students have read your article which came out early this year .
they know you are an expert in that field .
i appreciate their invitation .
i would be happy to do that but my problem is time .
let me see .
ok , i can make it since it &apos;s also a good opportunity to exchange ideas with their professors .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
how about making it 7 : 00 to 9 : 00 thursday evening ?
sounds good .
then , we have settled our schedule .
this evening we &apos;ll start our first business .
what business ?
to have dinner with mr. zhang , the general manager of the company .
i &apos;ll come to pick you up at 6 o &apos;clock .
where should i meet you ?
in the lobby downstairs . i &apos;ll be waiting for you there .
ok , i &apos;ll see you at 6 : 00 .
then , bye for now .
good morning .
are you mr. donelson ?
yes , i am .
i believe mr. goto is expecting me .
yes sir , he is .
allow me to take your coat and umbrella .
shall i also keep these packages for you ?
no , i think i had better hold onto these for our meeting .
please make yourself comfortable and i &apos;ll inform mr. goto that you are there .
thank you .
mr. goto will be here shortly . he &apos;s been expecting you .
good afternoon , can i help you ?
yes , i would like to see someone about a new product our firm has developed .
do you have an appointment ?
no , i &apos;m afraid not , but i &apos;m sure someone in your accounting section would be interested in seeing what i have to offer .
i &apos;m sorry , but all equipment purchase is handled by mrs. furuta in the ordering section .
let me refer you to her office .
hello , my name is jones , i &apos;m looking for mr. black .
i &apos;m tom black , how can i help you , miss jones ?
i work for star communications limited , we sell communications equipment — — everything from fax machines to mobile phones .
i understand that you own a small business .
yes , i do . i operate an office supply business here in my home .
mr. black , do you have to travel around a lot for your business ?
yes , i do all my deliveries myself .
do you have a mobile phone ?
yes , i got one a few months ago . it &apos;s really helped me a lot .
do you have a fax machine ?
it &apos;s pretty much a business essential nowadays .
i have a fax-modem on my computer . i usually use it to receive faxes .
have you ever considered buying a fax machine ?
most people find it much more convenient to have a separate machine for faxes rather than receiving them on the computer .
why is that ?
with a computer fax-modern you can only receive faxes as long as the computer is on and it is set up to receive the fax .
a fax machine is always ready to receive faxes , no matter when it is .
also , it allows you to work on your computer uninterruptedly . you can &apos;t be connected to the internet or on the phone and receive a fax at the same time .
i haven &apos;t really had too many problems with that so far .
do you have a photocopier ?
no , it &apos;s too expensive to buy a photocopier and i don &apos;t have enough apace for one .
you can get a fax machine that has a built-in photocopier for a fraction of the price you would pay for just a photocopier .
plus a fax machine takes up much less space .
i didn &apos;t know there was such a thing .
they &apos;ve become very popular over the last few years , especially with small business owners like you because they save a lot of space .
how much do they cost ?
they can run anywhere from about three thousand to ten thousand dollars for a really good one .
it depends on the quality you need and how much you &apos;re willing to spend .
a machine of medium quality that meets the needs of most small businesses would run at around five thousand or six thousand dollars .
hat &apos;s cheaper than i expected . do you have any models i could look at ?
i don &apos;t have an actual fax-machine with me but i do have our catalogue .
you can look through it and mark a few that you think you &apos;d like .
if you want to see how one works , you can come in to our shop at 67 lincoln street .
are there a lot of different models to choose from ?
if you want i can point out a few that would probably most closely fit what you are looking for .
sure , go ahead .
excuse me , mr. smith .
will you give me a few minutes ?
yes . why ?
i &apos;d like you to tell me how to use this new computer .
with pleasure .
oh , miss carrie , if you are not too busy , could you do me a favour ?
i &apos;ll be glad to .
you know , i &apos;ve been asked to give a talk on environmental pollution .
well , i &apos;ve got most of this information i need , but there are some facts i &apos;d like to check about the recent statistics in japan . could you help me ?
certainly .
what would you like me to do ?
i &apos;d like to go to the library this afternoon , but you know how my japanese is , so i &apos;ll need your help .
could you come along with me for an hour or so ?
certainly .
good morning , sir , may i help you ?
yes , i am nicole bryant , representative of great wall power co .
i &apos;d like to see the person in charge of purchasing .
here &apos;s my card .
well , let me see .
i &apos;ll find out who is available .
mr. bryant , someone representing our purchasing department will be here in just a moment .
why don &apos; t you have a seat over there while you wait .
to be frank with you , mr. bryant , i &apos; m afraid our business is so poor that i really don &apos;t know if we can use what you have to show me .
well , mr. wells , that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m here to help build up business .
please let me show you how our product has done just that for other stores .
well , what do you have ?
we specialize in power saws and drills .
we have too many lines of these products already .
perhaps ; but i &apos;m not selling goods that remain on the shelf . i &apos;m selling goods at a larger profit .
what &apos;s your price range ?
please look at these pictures .
these saws are from fifty dollars to seventy dollars ; and these drills are from ten dollars up to twenty dollars .
do you have any samples with you ?
here you are .
this is the fifty-dollar saw , and the ten-dollar drill .
i represent coca cola trading co . we &apos; re interested in importing a complete bottling machine for exhibition and sale in our country .
if satisfactory , we may consider further orders .
well , this unit here on display is a full scale assembly of our latest machine .
what &apos;s your opinion ?
very splendid .
how about patent rights ?
we hve 5 international patents which we are ready to sell .
i can consider it .
do you have any literature i can take with me ?
yes , here are some catalogs and brochures .
how about the price list ?
here it is .
thanks , i &apos;ll contact you .
as i said , business is very slow right now and i wonder if you have any room for a reduction in price .
no organization can stay in business if its operations are based on an insufficient margin of profit .
of course , but we aren &apos;t selling power saws and drills made in chengdu .
you aren &apos;t because you haven &apos;t tried ours yet .
i would estimate that you could sell at least l0-20 dozens of our saws per month easily .
sounds excellent .
let me talk this over with my boss this afternoon and let you know later .
can i keep this catalogue ?
by the way , what &apos;s the room for mark-up ?
would you rather make 20 % and turn them over only once a month or would you rather make a l6 % profit and turn your goods over several times a month ?
we prefer the larger profit from a bigger turn-over .
certainly .
we &apos; re in business to make a profit , but this profit comes from both a good mark-up and having a high turn-over of stock .
right ?
very true .
i guess we could use a 16 % mark-up as long as the turn-over is high .
i think you would find it satisfactory .
a 16 % mark-up has worked very well for all our customers in the past .
i &apos;ve come here to discuss a reduction in price .
what seems to be the problem ?
frankly speaking , one of your competitors has offered us a price 20 % lower than yours .
and ?
i was asked to get a price reduction from your co .
how much do you think you could bring the price down ?
5 % , at the most .
even if we double the purchase quantity ?
in that case , we might be able to manage 8 % .
but if production were to be greatly increased , the bulk cost would be cheaper , wouldn &apos;t it ?
of course , we &apos;d like to continue using your product .
the quality is good , and we &apos;re accustomed to it .
we pride ourselves on quality.that &apos;s our best selling point .
we realize that .
the only problem is the price .
we have to ask you for a 10 % reduction .
but can you effectively handle the increase in quantity ?
you don &apos;t have to worry .
we &apos;ve expanded our distribution network .
we want to double our order .
did you have a chance to look over the information i gave you , mr. wrigley ?
yes , i did .
as i said before , your level of quality is very high . however , i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t accept these prices .
i see .
no offense , but if you want good quality , you have to pay for it .
that &apos;s true .
however , with this line of tennis rackets , you have stiff competition against you .
in what way ?
well , although your competitors &apos; products are not as good as yours , they &apos;re cheaper and more attractive , which will bring in quicker profits in the short term .
our products have sold very well in the north american market so far .
uh-huh , but your new rackets are not well-known , and the look isn &apos;t attractive enough-son the higher prices may push away customers .
let me get this straight . you feel that our rackets won &apos;t easily attract new customers because of the high price and design ?
that &apos;s right . though i understand you have a solid line , i have to look for a dependable profit .
i see .
if your order is large , we would offer you a bulk discount .
i really think it would be better at first for you to sell this new line of rackets at lower price .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s feasible . we &apos;ve already had an unexpected rise in materials costs . the price isn &apos;t very flexible .
how big an order are you thinking of ?
probably around a thousand items to begin .
at the prices you gave me , a fifteen percent discount would be good .
would you consider ten ?
i &apos;ll tell you what . let me take your samples back to my boss . we &apos;ll think it over and contact you later .
okay , that sounds fine .
alright , let &apos;s get down to business .
we need to make some final decisions on the price of the soccer safety equipment , the tennis nets , and the new rackets .
right .
because of the size of your order , and our successful deals in the past , we &apos;ll offer you a 15 % discount across the board .
that &apos;s good , but since you &apos;ve raised the price by 25 % , we still have a price rise of 6.25 % .
tom , we &apos;ve talked about this , and you knew the reason already .
yeah , i know .
it &apos;s okay for a low turnover item like the tennis nets . but for soccer equipment and tennis rackets , we won &apos;t make a satisfactory profit .
prices will be rising everywhere because of the rise in materials costs .
and with the summer coming , you &apos;ll really make a killing on all the soccer and tennis items .
yes , i know they &apos;re both summer sports . but what exactly are you suggesting ?
well , it &apos;s been my experience that decreasing your mark-up will increase your turnover rate .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s feasible .
we &apos;ve always used a 22 % mark-up on all items from active sports .
if you keep it at 22 % , you &apos;ll turn over the goods once , maybe twice a month . but if you lower it to 19 % , you &apos;ll double your turn-over rate .
how can you be so sure about that ?
it has worked well for our other customers .
as well , the rackets and soccer equipment will be in great demand in the summer season , as i said .
i guess a 22 % mark-up might be a little high . how-ever , the price rise will still be a shock to my boss .
tom , perhaps we can compromise on this .
if you can lower the mark-up , we can give you a 17 % discount . your order is important to us .
okay , i think you have yourself a deal .
i &apos;m very much impressed with your silks . the colours are charming and the feel is good .
i would be obliged for your quotation .
could you give me an idea as to the quantity you &apos;d like to order from us ?
as you know , any price depends on how large an order is .
this is the first time i &apos;ve dealt in chinese silks . i need to try the canadian market with a small quantity , though your silks have been enjoying a high reputation around the world .
as a start , i &apos;d like to order 500 bales .
that number is far below what we have expected , but it &apos;s reasonable for a start .
for single-palace silks , our current price is $ 135 per bale and $ 165 for double-palace .
you mean f. o. b . qingdao ?
yes .
please excuse my speaking candidly . i would tend to argue that the price you &apos;ve given is a bit on the high side . it compares very unfavourably with those of other origins , japan , pakistan and india , for instance .
considering the quantity of your order , this is the best offer we can make for you . we think it is rock-bottom price indeed .
i heard that the japanese silks are more brightly coloured and beautifully designed and their price is lower on the f. o. b. basis .
our company has an office in japan . a large quantity of our silks are sold there .
the latest market report might show that our f. o. b price is much lower than what you may possibly obtain from japan .
and you should not ignore the quality of our silks when comparing with that of the prices in the countries you named .
i &apos;m sorry to say really can &apos;t see my way to your quotation .
you know , no material , however attractive , will be sold , if it is expensive .
i won &apos;t accept your price unless you allow me a 10 % discount .
well , a 10 % discount is out of the question unless your order is a bit larger .
i hope you will reconsider it .
that seems to be a point that will slow down our talk . let &apos;s leave it to the end of the talk and deal with other terms first .
since you can &apos;t accept the term right away , i have no objection to your proposal .
what would you like to talk about first ?
i &apos;d like to talk about packing and packaging . proper packaging is as important as the quality of the product itself . what do you use for packing silks ?
we use transparent polyfilm to wrap the silks first and then pack them in cartons with double straps .
silks packed in cartons are not quite sea-worthy .
i once had a serious problem with a shipment of towels . most of the cartons were broken and damaged . it caused me great trouble .
the cartons are only the outer packing . inside is the transparent polyfilm wrapped silks .
that &apos;s good . a well-designed package helps tell the gods .
buyers are always influenced by the packages . your silks enjoy a high reputation in the world market . you can compete successfully in a good many commodities if you pack the goods properly .
i agree with you , but customers should also learn that appearances are deceptive sometimes .
that &apos;s true . the quality of the products is the first priority when marketing them .
speaking of the design , we can meet the client &apos;s needs for all sorts of designs and colours , but the cost will go up .
i see .
what is your normal packing , two bales or four bales in a carton ?
for a normal carton , we have four bales of the same colour in a carton , but we also have small packing with only one bale in a carton .
that &apos;s nice . probably you heard that many consumer products in our country are being sold through mail order houses and this business is booming . therefore , we have adopted small packing to suit this new development .
you mean you want small packing , right ?
i &apos;m no exception . even though the cost may be a little bit higher , it &apos;s worth it . that is the reason why i have to order a small quantity for a trial run .
one more point , a second development in packaging is that some customers are asking for consumer packs ; i mean a pack which allows the products to the put directly onto store shelves .
i understand .
with the diversified merchandising of supermarkets , there has been a trend toward smaller packages .
packing is a real skill .
anyway , mr. xu , we have settled the packing .
i will inform you of my decision concerning price tomorrow .
i must be off now. thank you and see you tomorrow .
see you .
by the way , i will pick you up at six for the peking opera .
sure . i will be ready by that time .
i almost forgot.see you at six .
mr. gordon house has accepted the price and terms of payment for 1,000 bales of silks .
he is having the final talk about shipment with mr. xu , before singing the formal contract .
mr. xu , i am quite satisfied with our previous talks concerning the silks .
now shall we go down to the maters concerning shipping ?
silks are seasonal goods in north america so i need a delivery within a month . can you make a prompt shipment ?
a prompt shipment ?
it &apos;s a real problem , for there &apos;s a great demand for shipping lately .
i know it &apos;s another hard nut to crack , but i have to have the silks for summer sale .
i understand that , but yesterday i was informed by our shipping department that liner space for north america up to the end of this month has been fully booked .
i &apos;m afraid we can do very little about a direct shipment until the second week of next month .
i understand tramps are still available
yes , but tramps are scarce . i &apos;m not sure whether there would be enough tonnage to make a full cargo , even if a tramp could be obtained .
is there any chance of transshipment being allowed ?
but transshipment adds to the expenses , risks of damage and sometimes may delay arrival , because there is also a shortage of transshipment space for north america .
anyway , we &apos;ll try .
we have very good connections with the china resources shipping and storage co . ltd. in hong kong .
this company has a great reputation in the shipping world .
and since it has long term agency agreements with many world-famous shipping companies , it can easily meet the client &apos;s varied demands .
i prefer direct shipment , of course , but if you can &apos;t get hold of a direct vessel , i may agree to have the goods transshipped at any port like dalian , shanghai or even hong kong .
you know , good quality , competitive price , all would mean nothing if the goods could not be put on the market on the market on time .
i see your point .
we &apos;ll check the situation about the connecting steamer right away .
the best way is to get a containerized vessel destined for vancouver .
i called home last night . my partner told me jardine shipping agent ltd. has a liner sailing from hong kong to canada around early june . if you could manage to catch that vessel , everything would be all right .
it &apos;s very hard for us to accept a designated on-carrier . are you sure the vessel will call at vancouver and she is not carrying a full load ?
i believe if we start immediately , there &apos;s still some hope .
and if worse comes to worst , please ship the goods to toronto or another port near vancouver .
good , then that would you say if we put it like this : &quot; shipment , first available steamer in june , port of destination , vancouver or toronto . transhipment at other ports allowed . &quot;
i think this is the earliest possibility .
fine .
we may put it in the clause of the contract .
i suggest that we talk about inspection and arbitration in case something unexpected happens .
that &apos;s necessary . it is an important formality in international trade .
if the goods are found disqualified or short on arrival , are we entitled to lodge claims ?
you have the right of re-inspection . and you may lodge claims with us if you find the quality or quantity does not conform to the contract and the bill of lading . there &apos;s no risk involved .
no , i hope not .
how do you stipulate the inspection for your imports ?
inspection must be conducted before shipment by recognized surveyors .
their reports may be taken as the basis for negotiating payment .
our bureau at the port of destination shall reinspect the goods upon arrival .
the inspection certificate issued by them shall serve as the basis for filing claims .
very reasonable.the interests of both the buyer and the seller are taken into account .
so as to our case , shall the silks be inspected by the surveyors before you conduct the shipment ?
yes . and your side may reinspect , if you like .
how do you conduct arbitration if a dispute occurs ?
we have the arbitration clause in our general terms and conditions , but our usual practice to settle a dispute is in a friendly way , with a view to developing a long-term relationship .
arbitration is generally the last resort .
i agree .
i also believe in developing friendly business relations .
well , mr. xu , i think we have settled most of the issues about my first business with you .
i feel that we will establish long-term relations between us .
i appreciate your patience with me .
and i hope you don &apos;t think i &apos;m a bore .
it &apos;s business .
no , not at all . a successful business needs prudence .
i think we have made a good start in our business and well begun is half done .
that &apos;s true .
next time i will bring more canadian businessmen to qingdao , because i see my bright future in this beautiful city .
you are welcome to qingdao any time .
mr. gordon house finally decides to accept the price . now he comes to mr. xu again for further talks on terms of payment .
good morning , mr. house . you contacted home last night ?
yes , i made a long distance call to discuss my problems with some of my colleagues .
what did they say about our business ?
all things considered , we &apos;ve agreed to your quotation on the c. i.f. basis .
but we &apos;ll do it on condition that both sides should try to come to a balanced trade , as far as circumstances permit .
yes , that &apos;s understood .
now let &apos;s come to the terms of payment .
i suggest that d / a should be used for this transaction .
i have to say no to your suggestion .
our usual practice requires all orders to be covered by l / c and therefore we can &apos;t make an exception in case .
you know l / c is the most commonly used mode of payment in import and export .
well , i don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t accept l / c , since other firms have accepted it .
i &apos;ll make arrangements with our band to open a confirmed , irrevocable l / c to cover our orders and shipment from qingdao to vancouver .
that &apos;s fine . and it must be settled in us dollars .
how long should our l / c be valid , that is , when should we set the expiry date ?
thirty days before shipment .
according to our company policy , the l / c must be a confirmed and irrevocable one , though we know for certain that an international businessman like you will never default .
i understand that since i am your new client and it is in line with the practice of international trade .
another thing to be discussed is that since i have never bought silks from you before , our customers demand that 90 per cent of the credit amount be paid on sight , that is , against the presentation of documents . the rest is to be paid after the silks have arrived in vancouver .
no , mr. house , that can &apos;t be done .
we have never done business on such terms .
we ask for full payment on sight , because we guarantee the quality for all our products .
quality is important , of course , but if your terms compare favourably with those of other suppliers , i have good reason to believe that we could place regular orders on you .
we &apos;d like to do business with you , but only on the terms of international practice and standards .
i know our products sell extremely well in north america , especially in summer .
with good quality and charming colour , they will attract your customers and you will certainly make a profit from business with us .
i believe silks will bring us closer ties .
thank you for encouraging me .
in fact , i am just worrying about what the silks will look like when i get them in vancouver .
i know very little about your cargo insurance policy .
that is why i put forth 90 percent of the credit amount to be paid on sight .
we have insurance companies everywhere and they deal with all sorts of insurance concerning cargo damage , such as fpa , wpa and tpnd etc .
if you want to know the detailed insurance business we may seek advice from the pacific insurance company which is not far from here .
that &apos;s necessary .
we may discuss insurance later .
but now let &apos;s come back to our payment terms .
so many things have to be decided before signing the contract .
i agree with you .
but our terms of payment are definite . i can not make any changes .
well , it seems that the only way for me is to accept your idea .
would you please repeat some of the main points ?
my pleasure .
open a l / c 30 days before shipment ; cover your orders and other expenses in us dollars .
the total amount must be paid in full upon receipt of the documents .
all is clear .
it &apos;s been a pleasure talking with you . mr. xu . you are one of the best negotiators i &apos;ve ever know .
i hope we &apos;ll have many years of fruitful cooperation .
i hope so.and i look forward to the day we sign our contract .
yes .
after all the things are cleared up , we can find a place to cheer our success qingdao beer , okay ?
sure , i &apos;d like that and with seacucumber .
no , no way .
both laugh .
hello ! may i speak to mr. johnson , please ?
yes.this is johnson speaking .
this is steven lee , from microsoft.our manager would like to invite you to dinner .

yes .
on weekends i served some companies as a salesperson in their sales promoting campaign , and i &apos;ve been the tutor of five middle school students to help them with their english in the past one year .
do you call yourself introverted or extroverted ?
it just depends .
when i promoted sales for sun co . i was quite extroverted and persuasive .
when i was promoted to the director of sales department , i got along quite well with the staff members ; i like interacting with them .
on the other hand , in my spare time i prefer to be alone , thinking about my work and organization , my past , present and future , my failure and success , chinese and foreign development and political situation , or anything i &apos;d like to . at this time i &apos;d rather call myself introverted .
do you have any questions to ask , mr. li ?
yes .
when can you make a decision ?
by the end of next month .
how can i contact you about our decision ?
you can call me at this number between seven and ten in the evening .

ok .
i &apos;d like to make an appointment with dr.cooper.
could you arrange it for me ?
yes .
would tomorrow morning be all right with you ?
sorry , i &apos;ve got a meeting from nine to ten .
what about monday afternoon ?
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s fully engaged .
could you make it another time ?
jim , are you doing anything special this weekend ?
yes .
peter and i have promised to call on a new customer .
oh , well , never mind .
but i was thinking of asking you and your wife to go out for dinner .
that sounds great .
i wonder if we could make it some other time .
how about sunday evening , at seven o &apos;clock .
that &apos;ll be all right . see you then .
a tourist takes a city tour with a tour group . they are at the gate of window of the world , a place of interest in shenzhen .
would you please wait for a minute ?
i &apos;ll buy the tickets .
all right .
here are your tickets .
thank you .
attention , please . the time of sightseeing is 4 hours . we will meet at the theatre at 5 : 30 . is that ok ?
yes , that &apos;s ok .
then let &apos;s go in .
it is a new park , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it was opened last year .
why is it called window of the world ?
well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world &apos;s tourist attractions as well .
oh , how wonderful !
it is a place of the marvelous sights of the world , natural landscapes , folklore and social customs as well as ethnic songs and dances . it is an absolutely fantastic world where tourists can find much pleasure .
oh , that &apos;s great !
this is the world square . that is the area of asia . this is the area of europe . that is the area of america .
that &apos;s beautiful .
in the evening at about 7 o &apos;clock a drama will be put on at the theatre in the park .
oh , i am afraid it will be a hard time for me .
i can &apos;t understand a single chinese word .
don &apos;t worry , it is a dance drama .
the characters in the drama will dance throughout the play .
the aside will be spoken in english and chinese .
so you needn &apos;t worry about the language . i think you will have a good time this evening .
that is great !
look , this is the famous world trade centre .
it &apos;s huge , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
would you like to go to the top and have a bird &apos;s eye view of the city ?
why , of course .
where can we take the elevator ?
this way , please .
oh , we &apos;re in the sky .
the view is so breathtaking .
which is the best way approaching the great lakes ?
well , we should get on board a ship and start from the lake ontario .
lake ontario ?
yes .
it &apos;s the smallest of the great lakes , but it &apos;s deep , with a maximum sounding of 802 feet .
compared with the other lakes , ontario is more elusive .
is the famous niagara falls there ?
yes .
its sheer thunderous drop has been an elusive barrier between the ontario and other lakes .
but the erie lake is the one that people talk about a lot .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s a killer of small draft .
it has a reputation for treacherous flash storms .
how about others ?
superior is the worst storm lake ; lake huron is the second largest of the lakes ; and lake michigan is the only one of the lakes that is entirely within the u.s.
where shall we go today , my . peng ?
are there any places of historical interest here ?
yes . there are few , and most of them are not very old .
but i really like to recommend guangxiaosi temple .
i &apos;ve heard of it .
is it very far ?
no .
we can walk there in about twenty minutes .
it is one of the oldest sights in guangzhou .
local legend has it that it existed even before the city was established .
sounds very interesting and it must be worth a visit .
now , let &apos;s see the aviary first .
all right .
look , a pair of eagles from north america .
huge birds , aren &apos;t they ?
and so stately .
what are those repulsive-looking birds of prey in the cage beside them ?
they &apos;re hawks , buzzards and vultures .
they are vicious looking creatures .
look at the falcons .
look at the peacock . it is beautiful !
so proud and so beautiful !
well , look at the turkeys , swans , and ducks .
let &apos;s go nearer .
we &apos;d better go and see the carnivorous animals .
just feast your eyes on that majestic lion prancing about its cage !
he seems fully aware of being &quot; the king of beasts &quot; .
those sleek leopards are very fascinating .
i &apos;ve seldom seen such beautiful furs .
oh , here are the jackals , wolves , and wild cats .
what a horrible , mournful noise they &apos;re making .
those white and black giant pandas are gentle and lovable , though .
here we are . this is the taipei palace museum .
what are you especially interested in seeing ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
in fact , i know very little about chinese art and history . but can you give me some details about this building ?
it &apos;s built in the classical chinese style , with a curved roof .
what are those small statues on the roof ?
in the old days they were used to cover the nails that held the roof together , because roofs were made of wood .
nowadays , the statues are just for decoration .
that &apos;s the same style roof as on the concert hall , right ?
it seems like i &apos;ve seen it before .
right .
they &apos;re the same style , but as you can see , the colors are different .
the palace museum is yellow , which stands for the emperor .
how did the palace museum get such a large collection ?
this art collection was the emperors &apos; .
how old is the collection ?
some of the bronze pieces go back to the 17th century b.c. , but the collection itself was set up by the first emperor of the sung dynasty over a thousand years ago .
over a thousand years ?
incredible !
let &apos;s go inside . i can &apos;t wait to check it out !
o.k.
you know , most of the collection here was put together during the ching dynasty .
so , what do you think ?
i was impressed with the landscape paintings , and all the jade carvings .
that jade cabbage just can &apos;t be beat !
yeah , the colors were very realistic , and t was so carefully carved .
what else did you like ?
i really liked the calligraphy . i wish i could understand what it said . the writing was beautiful .
i &apos;m glad you enjoyed it .
i &apos;d like to return these books .
let me see .
these books are two weeks overdue . i &apos;m sorry , you have to pay a fine .
how much ?
just a minute , please .
let me check .
oh , it comes to $ 3 altogether .
here are $ 5 .
here is the receipt and your change .
can i help you ?
yes . i would like to apply for library card .
have you ever had a library card here before ?
no . i moved here last week .
i see 。
here &apos;s an application form .
please read the instructions and fill out the form .
here you are .
anything else ?
good . but i also need to have a look at your driver &apos;s license , name , address , and . telephone number .
please wait a minute , your new library cared will be ready in no time .
thank you .
can i help you ?
yes . i &apos;d like to borrow a copy of expressions in english conversation .
sorry , all the copies have been checked out .
oh , that &apos;s very disappointing .
could you recommend any book of spoken english ?
certainly .
how about a dictionary of spoken english ?
ok , i &apos;ll take it .
do you like to read romantic stories ?
not much . i prefer detective stories to romantic ones because i find them more exciting and interesting .
what kind of books do you usually borrow besides those ?
i also enjoy science books .
you are a science student , aren &apos;t you ?
yes , i am .
why , tom . see you again here .
yes . i want to borrow the newly-published biography of president clinton .
i came yesterday but didn &apos;t find any .
did you ask the librarian to reserve ?
yes .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve come again today .
you won &apos;t be disappointed this time .
i don &apos;t think i will .
is that the famous st. paul &apos;s cathedral ?
yes .
although city skyscrapers now tower over st. paul &apos;s , none of these new buildings has the dignity and presence of christopher wren &apos;s baroque church .
it seems to preside over london like a benevolent spirit .
it &apos;s said that st. paul &apos;s cathedral is the only english cathedral built between the reformation and the late nineteenth century .
yes , it &apos;s also exceptional that it took 35 years to complete the construction .
now we are entering from the west end .
and inside , there is an unbroken vista down the full length of the church .
from the back of the nave , you would see the marble alter designed by stephen dykes brower .
where is the whispering gallery ?
it &apos;s in the south side .
a whisper against the wall is said to be clearly audible over a hundred feet away across the void .
what a great scene !
yes .
i &apos;ve never seen such a crowded beach as santa monica .
people of all professions and age groups come here every summer on the weekends .
it &apos;s a time for fun and relaxation .
that &apos;s an important part of modem americans &apos; lives .
they like to go to the beach in the summer , especially people who live in big cities .
these vacationers come here with their friends or families .
would you please do me a favor ?
yes ?
could you take a photo of me here ?
certainly .
thank you .
what shall i do ?
this is an automatic one . you press this button .
all right .
step forward a little . say cheese !
thank you very much .
not at all .
i &apos;ve never expected the eiffel tower to be so magnificent .
it &apos;s pity we &apos;ve not got enough time to visit it today .
it is one of the single most recognizable structure in the world .
it weighs about 7 000 tons but exerts the same pressure on the ground as average-size person sitting in a chair .
that is a miracle , indeed .
it was designed by alexander eiffel , wasn &apos;t it
you are quite right .
his fame rested mainly on his iron bridge .
he was also the designer of the statue of liberty .
really ?
he was something .
the tower is 1 , 056 feet high .
on a fine day you can see it some 40 miles away .
for years it remained the tallest man-made structure on earth , until such skyscrapers as the empire building surpassed it .
i guess people must have offered their admiration to eiffel for his pioneering contribution .
initially , artists and writers vehemently denounced the tower although later generations sang its praise .
it was once called &quot; a giraffe , &quot; &quot; the world &apos;s greatest lamppost , &quot; &quot; the iron monster . &quot;
some nature lovers feared it would interfere with the flight patterns of birds over paris .
i didn &apos;t know that .
of course , i have included it in my itinerary .
to see it best , you had better visit it gradually .
how ?
you can visit the tower in three stages .
first , you can take the elevator to the first landing . there you have a view over the rooftops of paris .
and then you come to the second landing . the second landing provides a panoramic look at the city .
the third and final stage give the most spectacular view.you &apos;d better not go to the top landing directly .
i see .
what can i see within the tower ?
there &apos;s so much for you to visit .
for example , on the third level , you can visit eiffel &apos;s office .
in the office you can see wax figures depicting the engineer receiving thomas edison .
that &apos;s fabulous .
tomorrow morning i &apos;ll get up early an visit it first .
but the tower won &apos;t be open until nine .
excuse me , dr.steward , i wonder if i could talk with you about my paper .
yes , of course .
when is good ?
will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?
now let me check my schedule .
ok , you could come to my office then .
scene 2 at the registry
good afternoon !
this is the registry office , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
good afternoon !
have you come to register ?
of course .
i &apos;m sorry to say it &apos;s a bit too late .
we were just going to close up .
would you come tomorrow instead ?
but i &apos;ve come all the way from china , you know .
i arrived in london only an hour or two ago , and came here straight from the airport .
so you &apos;re from china-that &apos;s a very long way off , i must say .
you are among the last batch of students to check in .
i could have come earlier if there hadn &apos;t been the visa problem .
the british home office was to blame for that .
well , that &apos;s a long story .
anyhow , i &apos;m here to check in now .
where is your luggage ?
i left it at the airport on purpose , so as to get here before you close up for the day .
so here i am---just in time !
you are not going to shut the door on my face , are you ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t dream of doing such a thing to anyone straight from the other side of the globe !
your name , please ?
i just want to know your surname , so i can look it up in the register .
li . it &apos;s spelt with two letters only : l and i.
turning the pages
let me see . l. i.
ah !
here it is .
but the other name happens to be &quot; li &quot; as well !
have we got it right ?
yes , it &apos;s absolutely correct .
female , 24 , chinese , single , post-graduate , english literature-right ?
yes , that &apos;s me all right .
good !
would you sign here ?
li li signs .
now , just put down the date , please !
. thank you .
is that all ?
yes , as far as checking in is concerned .
you know when the term begins , don &apos;t you ?
will you look at the term begins , don &apos;t you ?
it tells you where post-graduates should go on the first day of the term .
i &apos;ll look at the notice-board in a minute .
i &apos;m more anxious to know where i should go today .
will you tell me where the women &apos;s dormitories are ?
but there is no dormitory in this university .
not in the campus ?
dormitory !
campus !
you sound as if you had landed in america instead of england .
what are you laughing at ?
i don &apos;t get it .
you see , miss li , students in this university don &apos;t live in dormitories ; they stay in hostels or boarding-houses as a rule , if they don &apos;t have homes it london .
i was told this afternoon that london university was all over the city .
is that so ?
yes , the university buildings are scattered in london .
where shall i stay for the night , then ?
mrs. dobbs in the person in this office who helps new-comers with accommodation , but she &apos;d gone home long before you walked in .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to spend the night in a hotel .
i know what we can do : will you please ring her up for me ?
i want to ask be where i could be put up for the right .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be glad to help somebody who &apos;s come all the way from china .
ok . here is lake itasca , the true source of the mississippi .
yes .
help me to take down the canoe , and our exploring is beginning .
but the river at that point is only about ten feet wide , we can get into trouble there .
maybe . this is the true exploration .
thanks heavens ! we pass it successfully .
look ! the disjointed stone bridge blocks our way .
i think we have to pull the canoe out , beat a passage through the prickly brush and carry the canoe around to the stream below the bridge .
the river loops back and forth upon itself , it has tripled or quadrupled the distance to our object .
don &apos;t worry .
the river will leave the swamp and become straight soon .
oh , great !
here we reach the benmidji lake .
the river becomes a noble stream of 200 feet wide .
we begin a 400-mile delightful canoe trip tomorrow morning .
have you visited niagara falls ?
for several times .
it has become a tired old tourist sight .
but if you look it over in an airplane , becomes something completely new .
really ?
yes .
you should realize that niagara falls is not tired , only the way of looking is tired .
you are all right .
for the ground tourist , the approach to niagara is flat , and since an industrial area has grown up around the falls , they are surrounded by concrete , asphalt and a strong chemical smell on both the united states and canadian sides .
only a stretch of lawn and trees reminds us of the wilderness that once was there .
can we see its real face at altitude ?
of course .
so , i think we should visit it again .
thank you very much .
you &apos;re welcome .
they walk out of baohe dian and stop by a huge marble ramp with dragons and clouds in bas-relief .
look at this ramp .
it was cut out from a complete slab and weighs 250 tons .
it &apos;s really huge !
what &apos;s unusual about it is that , without the modern machinery , the people 500 years ago managed to move such a monster from fangshan all the way here .
where is fangshan ?
about 100 kilometers southwest of beijing .
it &apos;s a miracle .
how did they do it ?
they dug a well every 500 meters and built an ice road by purring the well water on the road in cold winter .
then they placed the slab on a huge sledge and pulled it all the way here .
truly resourceful .
mr dewey bents and takes some close shots at the ramp .
i wish we could stay here longer , but there is so much more to see .
so shall we do it fast and get to the inner court quickly ?
by all means .
after the tour in the inner court , they come out of the imperial garden .
well , this is the end of the tour .
you must be a bit tired after all this walking and standing .
that &apos;s all right .
i &apos;ve enjoyed everything you showed me .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
okay , we still have some time . would you like to do some shopping on our way back to the hotel ?
i &apos;d love to .
good , let &apos;s go .
taxi !
they enter the hall .
i suppose this is emperor &apos;s throne .
yes .
looks imposing , but i &apos;m afraid id feel more comfortable sitting in the armchair back in my office .
i agree with you .
they arrive at zhonghe dian .
this is zhonghe dian , or the hall of central harmony .
the emperor used to take a rest in this hall on his way to the hall of supreme harmony .
he also met his cabinet members here .
this is baohe dian , or the hall of preserving harmony .
every three years the emperor held a palace examination in this hall for scholars pursuing high literary degrees .
what was the purpose of such examination ?
for the emperor , such examination was a tool for selecting senior officials to serve his dynasty .
for the examinees , passing the exam meant guaranteed high position and great credit to the family .
what a riot of color there is with all kinds of flowers in blossom !
do you see those red , white and yellow roses blooming by the fountain ?
what are those small yellow and white flowers sprouting up on the lawn ?
the yellow ones are buttercups and the white ones are daisies .
i wonder why they weren &apos;t planted in proper flower beds .
they look more natural peeping up out of the grass like that .
aren &apos;t those azalea bushes beautiful ?
yes .
here &apos;s an interesting bed with a mixture of daffodils , violets , lilies of the valley and bluebells .
by the way , do you know much about how to grow flowers ?
oh , not much .
but my mother grows a lot at my home .
it takes plenty of time to take care of them .
of course .
you &apos;ve to water them and see that they get enough bright sunlight .
it really takes a lot of knowledge .
look !
the water of the lijiang river is so clear and pure .
yes . the reflections of the hills in the water looks so real , and the farmlands spread out like green carpets .
fantastic !
i feel as if in a wonderland .
the landscape in guilin is characterized by its green hills , clear water , pretty rocks and grotesque caves .
i hear it &apos;s a fascinating experience to visit the caves .
as planned , we will visit some famous caves , right ?
yes .
in the caves you &apos;ll see splendid stalactites , stalagmites , stone curtains and flowers .
they form various fascinating scenes .
there !
the hill looks like an elephant .
i remember seeing it somewhere .
it is the elephant trunk hill . it looks like an elephant drinking water with its long trunk .
what a beautiful sculpture of nature !
look at those bamboo rafts over there with men and big birds .
the birds are busy catching fish .
the birds are trained cormorants .
the boat is going faster now .
yes .
pretty soon we &apos;ll see the huashan hill .
what &apos;s special about it ?
it &apos;s another wonder along the lijiang river .
seen from some distance away , the different shades in color on the cliff appear like a herd of horse .
please call my attention when we are there .
you can count on it .
as palace go , i think the grandiose building facing down the mall is neither old or attractive .
in fact , the palace &apos;s best facade , nash &apos;s long garden front , only can be enjoyed by those invited to one of her majesty &apos;s garden parties .
but how about us ?
we have to wait .
wait ?
yes .
when the trees are bare , we can see it from the top of the double deck bus heading down gloucester place .
what a pity it is !
but you can also get a glimpse of nash &apos;s architecture by visiting the royal mews in buckingham palace road .
really ?
yes , it is also designed by nash .
what are the best places to visit here , please ?
it depends .
if you are interested in the city , you might like to tour it by car .
i can be your guide .
we &apos;ll leave the afternoon free .
you can do some shopping in the shopping mall , if you like .
great .
what do you suggest we see ?
i suggest we visit the metropolitan museum of art first .
now let &apos;s go .
look , people are jogging along the river .
here we are .
the exhibits are really special .
i enjoy the paintings very much .
this is broadway .
there are lots of theaters .
this way leads to times square .
every new year &apos;s eve , thousands of new yorkers and visitors welcome in the new year here .
and we should not miss seeing greenwich village a little west of washington square .
hello , mr. liang !
could you do me a favour ?
yes , what can i do for you ?
as i &apos;m a stranger here , could you accompany me on a tour round the famous yuexiu park ?
certainly , i &apos;ll be glad to .
here we are in the yuexiu park , mr. williams .
it is the largest park in the city .
shall we go and see the zhenhai tower first ?
good .
. oh , it &apos;s a very imposing tower with red walls and green tiles in the typical chinese architectural style .
yes , it is also known as the &quot; five-storey tower &quot; built in the ming dynasty .
it now houses the museum of guangzhou .
when we go up to the top floor , at the balcony , you can have a bird &apos;s eye view of the whole city of guangzhou .
very interesting !
after visiting the zhenhai tower , they come to magnificent stone statue .
mr. williams , this is the famous five-goat statue , the symbol of guangzhou .
our city is also known as the &quot; city of goats &quot; .
i think you &apos;ve heard this name ?
yes , and there is a beautiful story behind this name .
i &apos;ve read about this from a book .
this statue is really a magnificent piece of art .
yuexiu park offers a nice combination of both charming scenery and cultural activities .
in this park there are a grand stadium , swimming pools , artificial lakes , a roller-skating court , and a special playground for children .
shall we have look at all these places ?
sure , i &apos;ll be delighted to do so .
can you tell me something about disneyland ?
sure .
are you going to take a trip ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ll visit there with my wife for a couple of days .
i &apos;ve been there only once , but i &apos;ll tell you what i can remember .
when did you go there ?
that &apos;s quite a few years ago .
i stayed there for two day .
did you see much ?
no , i just visited some important places .
you can &apos;t see all of the amusement park in one day .
how big is the park ?
about 180 acres .
it has five main sections.they &apos;re named main street , frontier-land , fantasy-land , tomorrow-land and adventured-land .
disneyland is often called a &quot; magic kingdom &quot; .
there &apos;re so many things to see in the park .
what did you enjoy most ?
jungle river boat safari , sleeping beauty castle walkthrough , submarine voyage and tom sayer island , i think , are all fascinating .
it sounds like you had a wonderful time .
yes , it sure was a happy and memorable experience for me .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll enjoy your visit too .
they are now in the park .
look !
that &apos;s the famous parade of walt disney characters .
wow !
snow white and the seven dwarfs . this is a true fairyland .
look who &apos;s coming !
oh mickey mouse and donald duck , lao li , i &apos;d like to have a picture taken with them .
okay .
get ready . cheers .
. great !
one more !
all right , one more .
now shoot this one for me .
the one i took last time was blurred .
i &apos;ll take three shots for you .
so don &apos;t move .
one two . three . there must be a good one .
now let &apos;s take the jungle cruise .
such a line !
it &apos;ll take ten to fifteen minutes , but it &apos;s really worth it .
what &apos;s the cruise about ?
you &apos;ll soon find out by yourself .
at the exit of the cruise .
oh , it &apos;s truly hair-raising !
was it not worth it ?
oh , of course .
that &apos;s another experience i can boast of when i &apos;m back in china .
i was also scared to death the first time i took the cruise , but i still like it .
people like to scare themselves sometimes .
i agree .
well what &apos;s next ?
after such a horrible experience , i &apos;d suggest something sweet and romantic .
what about snow white and the seven dwarfs ?
let &apos;s go .
it is a lovely day , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is . it is a lovely day for an outing .
what places of interest are you going to show us today ?
we will go to splendid china first and then to safari park .
splendid china ?
yes , it is a park . it features all the man-made and natural wonders of china in miniature .
oh , i see .
this park can enable us to tour the whole china just in one day .
oh , that &apos;s great !
scene 2 at shanhai pass
sun lin and prof. white are looking at the great wall from a distance .
look !
the great wall stretches right into the sea .
our forefathers built this wall to defend them-selves from invasion .
that &apos;s why they had to make it so long , over mountains and across plains , from the land to the sea .
i see .
so the great wall was built for the sake of peace .
in that case , it should be called &quot; the peace wall &quot; .
that &apos;s not a bad idea , but it &apos;s a bit too late now .
you should have made this suggestion to the first chinese emperor long ago .
when would that be ?
you should have spoken to him about it in the qin dynasty , which was only a bit over 2,000 years back .
i know i &apos;m not young any longer , but not so old as all that .
let &apos;s go up these steps !
it &apos;s a rather steep slope .
will you give me your handbag and hold on to my arm ?
thank you !
as you know , the westerners have completed many huge projects , but none of them beats this wall in scale .
the american astronauts saw it with their naked eyes from the moon , didn &apos;t they ?
yes , they saw a very small world , and this long , long wall .
anyway , the western countries are advanced in science and technology .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to london to study electronics .
i hope you &apos;ll bump into my daughter , rebecca , when you are there .
if you come across a muddle-headed girl , it may be her .
but there are so many students at london university ; it &apos;s not very likely should meet your daughter .
oh , you never can tell .
it &apos;s small world after all , just as what the astronauts saw from the moon .
perhaps you are right .
gosh !
where is my bag ?
it was in my hand a few minutes ago .
here you are , my dear clear-headed professor !
you have visited yellowstone already , could you tell me something about this famous national park ?
my pleasure .
the best part of yellowstone lies in the northwest of wyoming .
in 1872 , it became the world &apos;s first national park .
it &apos;s said that yellowstone is a wonderful land which has intrigued the minds of men and moved them , inspired them .
yes .
the wonder , the mystery and the beauty of this plateau challenged the early explorers .
here in yellowstone were features of such significance that men were inspired to evolve a new philosophy for the land , a new land-use ethic based on preserving a part of the natural scene .
but to many , it is a fleeting glimpse of a geyser , a bear , or a canyon through the window of a passing car .
more than this .
when you visit it , you &apos;ll find that yellowstone is more than a collection of scenic features and natural curiosities .
can i help you ?
yes . i &apos;d like to know what &apos;s playing for the next two weeks .
yes . let &apos;s see . on the 29th and 30th , friday and saturday nights , dave brubeek will be in town .
however , that &apos;s all sold out .
then next wednesday marcel marceau will be doing a one-nighter .
are there any good seats left for his performance ?
no .
i see . well , how about next friday or saturday ?
saturday the 7th there &apos;s going to be a local rock concert , and we have lost of seats left for that .
well , my wife and i do want to see something while we &apos;re here , so why not a rock concert ?
what time does it begin ?
at 6 : 30 p.m.
which seats would you suggest ?
how many tickets do you need ?
just two .
the acoustics is quite good . it doesn &apos;t make much difference whether you sit in the front or the back .
i suggest you sit toward the back . those seats are much cheaper , 3.50 dollars each .
seats 35a and b aren &apos;t bad .
of course , if you want to go to the stage to present flowers , you can have better seats .
we aren &apos;t not teenagers . those toward the back will be fine , thank you .
can i get two tickets for this evening ?
yes.would you like to sit close to the stage ?
yes .
are these seats all right ?
yes .
thank you .
may i have four tickets for this evening ?
sure .
what about four tickets in row 4 ?
i don &apos;t like seats so close to the stage .
how about row 9 ?
that &apos;s fine .
thank you .
do you have any cancellations ?
somebody just returned two tickets for the second show .
can i take them ?
sure .
what shall i do to enjoy the revue show of &quot; moulin rouge &quot; tonight ?
you are from taiwan , aren &apos;t you ?
then , i recommend a night tour called &quot; moulin rouge and pairs by-night &quot; .
how much is it ?
about 100 francs or 25 american dollars .
what are included in that night tour ?
it includes a show at one of the leading night clubs in pairs and a fantastic show at &quot; moulin rouge &quot; .
additionally , two drinks at each place are included .
where should i make reservations and get a ticket ?
here .
what is the starting time of that night tour and how long .
it starts at 10 : 00 at night and is over about two o &apos;clock in the morning .
two o &apos;clock in the morning ?
don &apos;t be surprised .
night in pairs begins at midnight , as you may know .
have you got any seats for firelight this evening ?
yes , we have .
how much is it ?
seven dollars .
what time does the evening presentation start ?
at 6 o &apos;clock .
and what time will it be over ?
at 8 : 30 .
do you still have the reserved seats for tonight ?
how lucky you are !
we have two tickets only . they are e15 and e16 .
how about the location for these seats ?
about the center .
is there a guide for the seating of your theater ?
here it is . your seats are located around here .
okay . i &apos;ll take them .
how much are they ?
24 dollars for two tickets .
may i help you ?
our seats are e15 and e16 . could you take us to these seats ?
yes , sir .
watch your step , please .
looking good , tom !
you can lift a lot of weight !
how about thirty more kilos ?
thirty more !
no way !
i &apos;m not arnold schwarzenegger !
ha ! ha ! ha ! what do you think of the facilities here ?
not bad .
weight machines , rowing machines , sauna , hot tub . everything we need . i can &apos;t complain .
let &apos;s go to the hot tub . we can talk more easily there .
good idea .
let &apos;s take a break . i &apos;m pretty tired after all this hard work .
tom , we have a small problem with the factory work , and i think you should know about it .
go ahead , i &apos;m listening .
you know the price of oil has gone up , so it &apos;s more expensive to ship materials . and because of that , factory production costs have also gone up .
what are you getting at ?
well , we &apos;re going to have to raise our prices .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not very happy about that , howard we &apos;ve been doing business with you because your prices are more competitive than those in korea and hong kong .
when it rains , we all get wet , tom .
prices in korea and hong kong have to go up as well .
that &apos;s true , but maybe oil prices will go down soon .
i really don &apos;t believe they might go down very soon .
wait , wait .
if we keep our prices low , we could attract customers away from our competitors .
but that &apos;s impossible !
even if bigger companies lower prices to fight us , they &apos;ll be taking too big a chance . they won &apos;t last long and neither will we .
hmm . we &apos;ll have to think about this some more .
right now , i just want to relax .
o.k.
let &apos;s settle this later at the office .
there is a knock at the front door .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me , olivia .
oh , is that you , shirley ?
come in , please !
i haven &apos;s seen you for a long time .
how are things with you ?
fine !
and how are you and your mother ?
also good !
thank you !
i &apos;ve come to tell you my mother and i are going to the theatre this coming saturday .
would you care to join us ?
with the greatest pleasure , shirley .
it &apos;s very kind of you to invite me .
what &apos;s on that interests you ?
shakespeare &apos;s &quot; romeo and juliet &quot; .
it &apos;s being staged by famous british theatrical troupe .
wonderful !
by the way , will it be an evening performance or a matinee ?
we want to see the first night performance .
that &apos;s great !
i also prefer an evening performance .
i &apos;ll let you know the exact time for the performance as soon as i get the tickets .
see you later .
very well .
goodbye !
how did you like the play , olivia ?
i think the acting and the stage effects were all superb !
this is the most successful performance i &apos;ve seen in recent years !
i am of the same mind .
i was so attracted by the marvelous acting that at times i completely forgot myself .
i &apos;ve never seen an audience applaud so much before .
i think there were at least four curtain calls .
i know the story of the play well , still i was deeply moved by the denouement of the play .
i enjoyed every minute of the performance .
i &apos;m awfully glad you enjoyed yourself .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
yes , it is .
it is not my seat . then where is my seat ?
which row and which seat is your ticket ?
it is row c , seat 9 .
you are mistaken . your seat is not here . it is on the right .
thank you very much .
did you attend the concert last night , tom ?
yes , i went with my girlfriend .
how did you like haimei &apos;s singing ?
she sang well , i thought .
she sang a popular song , didn &apos;t she ?
yes , a very charming love song .
what type of music do you like best ?
i like classical music best . how about you ?
i have a special liking for light music .
as i know , american pop music is played all over the world and is enjoyed by all ages in many countries .
i wonder why it enjoys such great popularity .
the reasons for its popularity are its fast pace and rhythmic beat .
how is the night life in guangzhou , mike ?
very interesting .

this is a big theater , and .
miss wang and mr. bush are now sitting in the karaoke room .

laser discs .
that makes it easier to locate the songs people want to sings .

miss wang , would you like to have a try , too ?
how about this one &quot; the way we were &quot; ?
oh , no , i &apos;m a poor singer .
my voice can &apos;t reach the high notes .
it doesn &apos;t matter . since they &apos;re using laser discs here , it is very easy to change the key . you can just ask the host to lower the key .
come on , miss wang .
all right .
after their singing , people applaud .
thank you , thank you .
mr. bush , would you treat us to another song ?
o.k.

some minutes later
waiter , could i have a picture taken with that young lady .

i &apos;ll talk about it with her .
good evening , gentlemen .
how many are there in your party ?

of course you can .
how do you charge for a private room ?
it is charged by the hour .
eighty yuan an hour .

yes . here is a list of the english songs we have .

not a bad idea .
is there a good picture on ?
i don &apos;t know .
let &apos;s look at the newspaper .
what would you like to do tonight ?
i &apos;m not sure .
what about going to a movie ?
ok , let &apos;s call the theater to see what time the movie will be on .
do you know when american beauty will be on ?
it will be on tomorrow at the red star cinema .
great .
would you like to go with me ?
sure .
i feel like doing something tonight .
how about going to a movie ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
what &apos;s on tonight ?
which do you prefer , chinese or foreign movies ?
i &apos;m a movie fan .
but i prefer foreign movies , especially literary movies such as gone with the wind , red and black etc .
what would you like to do tonight ?
i &apos;m not sure .
what about going to a movie ?
ok , let &apos;s see what &apos;s on .
would you like to go to the movies tonight ?
what &apos;s on ?
there &apos;s an american horror film at victory cinema and there &apos;s a chinese feature at the international film festival at the university .
i don &apos;t feel like seeing a horror film . let &apos;s go to the chinese one .
i &apos;ve got an extra ticket.would you like to go to the movie with me ?
what &apos;s on ?
who am i.
it &apos;s in chinese and has english subtitles .
then i &apos;d like to go .
what &apos;s on at the grand cinema now ?
true lies .
what a contradictory name !
it sure is .
clowns play an important role in a circus .
yes , they make the circus lively and cause people to laugh .
look . there come tow of them .
what funny faces and costumes !
and funny performances .
oh , this is quite a show .
ah , he pretends to be dead .
the other is pouring water into his mouth .
that &apos;s incredible . he poured a big barrel of water into his mouth .
what a big stomach he has !
no , he didn &apos;t really pour the water into his mouth .
he poured it into a big plastic bag .
oh , i see .
it &apos;s very interesting .
settling bills
could you bring me the bill , please ?
yes , madam .
just one minute , please .
he brings the bill and the guest looks at it carefully
would you mind explaining this to me ?
what is item 6 ?
of course not .
maybe i could go through it for you .
number 1 is the cover charge .
the second item is the beer .
then your starter , your main course and the vegetables .
the main course was 36 yuan and not 33 yuan .
so item 6 is the difference .
oh , i see .
but how was i expected to know that ?
yes , madam .
they are a bit difficult to follow sometimes .
the seventh item is your second beer .
number 8 is your dessert and item 9 the cigarettes .
and how about the service charge ?
is that included ?
yes , that &apos;s marked down here , 10 % service .
good .
thank you .
now , can you take my credit card ?
i &apos;m afraid we don &apos;t accept credit cards .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
what about a check with a bank &apos;s card ?
waiter !
the bill , please .
very good , miss .
could i sign the bill ?
if you &apos;ve got the key card of our hotel , yes .
good . here is the card .
would you please wait for a moment while i telephone the front counter to check ?
all right .
sorry , miss .
the front counter tells us that you &apos;re completed your check-out procedures . so the key card is no longer available . please pay the bill in cash .
oh , i &apos;m awfully sorry .
how much do i owe ?
ninety yuan , six jiao and five fen .
here is one hundred yuan .
the change is for you .
thank you just the same .
thank you for coming . welcome to call again . goodbye .
goodbye .
can we have our bill , waitress ？
certainly , sir .
how would you like to have your bill , a bill for three of you or a bill for each ?
a bill for three of us , please .
by the way , which kind of money do you accept , us dollars or renminbi ?
either will do .
the bill is made out in renminbi . if you pay in us dollars , we &apos;ll convert renminbi into us dollars against today &apos;s exchange rate .
i see .
here &apos;s your bill , sir .
it &apos;s three hundred eighty-seven yuan and four jiao altogether .
please have a check on it .
wow !
nearly four hundred yuan for a single meal ?
if you wait a minute , gentlemen , i &apos;ll go over the details .
you had one shark &apos;s fin soup . that &apos;s eighty yuan . fried sea crab meat is one hundred yuan . this eighty-eight yuan is for fried prawns . there are also roast beijing duck , vegetables and your drinks . the service charge is also included , of course .
i think the charge is reasonable .
let me have a look at it . all right .
here &apos;s 400 hundred yuan .
just a moment , please . here is the invoice and change , twelve yuan and six jiao .
i hope you enjoyed your dinner .
see you next time .
could i have my bill , please ?
certainly , sir .
.
i &apos;m afraid there has been a mistake
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
what seems to be the trouble ?
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing .
look , the figure of 17.50 yuan appears here , then again here .
i &apos;ll just go and check it for you , sir .
yes , sir , you are quite right .
the cashier made a mistake .
i think you will find it correct now .
thank you .
we do apologize for that , sir .
that &apos;s right . no harm done .
now , can i pay by traveller &apos;s checks .
yes , you can , sir .
we &apos;ll give you the change in renminbi if you don &apos;t mind .
you needn &apos;t worry about that . there won &apos;t be much change out of $ 30 .
so you can keep the change .
that &apos;s very kind of you , sir . but there is no tipping in china .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know that .
you see , i just got in town yesterday from boston .
no tipping ?
that &apos;s good .
but just for curiosity &apos;s sake , how can you survive without tips ?
just as everybody else , you see , we are paid the same monthly wages as everybody in the restaurant .
i see .
the reason i was wondering whether you could make a living without taking tips is that in my county waiters and waitresses are paid a much lower hourly pay than people in non-tipping positions .
they expect the tips from guests to make up the difference .
if they don &apos;t get enough tips they won &apos;t be able to make a living .
and do they usually get enough tips ?
yes , they do most of the time .
they generally make pretty good money .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;ll go to the cashier &apos;s counter to settle the bill for you .
please wait for your change .
thank you .
if you &apos;re interested , i &apos;d like to take you to a dance this evening .
i &apos;d love to go , but i &apos;m not very good at dancing , you know .
that &apos;s not a problem .
if i go , would you promise to help me ?
sure .
i &apos;ll let you get acquainted with the place for a while , all right ?
all right .
i &apos;ve never seen a disco like this before .
would you like to try this dance ?
why not ?
how do you like this ballroom dance ?
i like it very much .
we &apos;d better stop idle talk and get down to business .
all right .
let &apos;s dance .
mary , may i have the favor to dance with you ?
sorry ! i &apos;m engaged for this foxtrot .
may i have that pleasure for the next waltz or tango ?
certainly .
may i invite you to dance ?
sorry , i &apos;m engaged for this tango .
may i have the pleasure for the next dance ?
sure .
let &apos;s do the disco .
i don &apos;t care much for disco dancing .
and i &apos;m too tired to move anymore .
all right , let &apos;s call it a day here .
ok .
i think we &apos;ve had enough fun for the day .
honestly , i &apos;ve got to fight to keep my eyes open right now .
you were the center of attention tonight , you know .
really ?
all right , let &apos;s call it a day .
i hope you &apos;ve enjoyed as much as i have .
were you at the dance last night , jane ?
yes , i was , and i brought a friend from another school .
i didn &apos;t see you there .
i was there , but there were so many people , and i didn &apos;t stay very long .
it was a nice dance , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes , i enjoyed it very much .
i danced and danced until late into the night.the band played very well , didn &apos;t they ?
yes .
the band , as i know , is mostly made up of students of our school , but the conductor is a professional musician .
as the new year &apos;s day is drawing near , we &apos;re planning a family dancing party .
would you like to join us ?
i &apos;ll be delighted to come .
bring your friends to the party .
yes . i will .
are you free this weekend ?
yes , i am .
what &apos;s up ?
would you like to go dancing with me ?
absolutely !
have you ever been to an occasion like this before ?
no , this is the first time .
i can see it &apos;s going to be an exciting evening .
yes , i think so .
let &apos;s find a place and listen to the music first .
shall i get you a drink or something .
yes , please . i think i need it .
here you are .
how do you like the music ?
to tell you the truth , i &apos;m not used to this kind of music . it &apos;s too fast .
i &apos;ve no idea about the beijing opera . could you tell me something about it ?
beijing opera is an integrated performing art on the chinese stage .
it originated in the qing dynasty .
in the late 1700s , two bands of performers form anhui and hubei provinces merged and a new kind of opera came into being . that is beijing opera .
you mean beijing opera did not originate in beijing , did it ?
no . but it got its recognition and development in beijing .
oh , i see .
beijing opera is a unique performing art that integrates singing , dialogue , acting and acrobatics . the characters of beijing opera are divided into four groups . they are sheng , dan , jing and chou .
what do they stand for ?
sheng is the male role . dan is the female role . jing is the martial role and chou is the clown .
you can easily tell them by their costume and make-up .
the colors and patterns on their &quot; painter &quot; faces have some symbolic meanings .
like what ?
for example , when red is the main color of the face , it suggests loyalty , blue suggests cruelty , yellow suggests cunning , and white suggests treachery .
it sounds interesting .
another interesting thing about beijing opera is that there were no female performers in the past and all the roles were played by men .
but now things have changed . we have both men and women performers .
what themes does beijing opera have ?
they mainly come from historical events , fictional tales , folk storied and classical literature .
and many modern ones deal with the present reality .
beijing opera seems to be a colorful and diverse art .
it is .
so you &apos;d better squeeze an evening in to see a beijing opera .
i will .
thank you .
how do you usually spend your weekends ?
going to a disco or to a karaoke bar , because i like singing and dancing .
do you know anything about peking opera ?
no , i don &apos;t . tell me something about it .
ok .
peking opera is a combination of music , dance , art and acrobatics .
oh , that sounds interesting .
how do they perform ?
all the actions , such as drinking , eating or rowing boats , are shown by the movements of actors and actresses .
i think i should go and see it when i visit china next year .
how do you like the play ?
i don &apos;t like it .
it is hard to understand and it is boring .
i prefer straight plays .
on the whole , the play isn &apos;t satisfactory at all .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
i think the acting could be better .
to be fair though , both costumes and scenery are marvelous .
well i don &apos;t like the men &apos;s costumes , but the women &apos;s dresses are lovely .
who &apos;s the actor who plays the doctor ?
that &apos;s william bush .
i watched a drama in which he played the hero .
last month the troupe were putting on tour shows in shanghai .
i thought he did well .
i didn &apos;t expect that he should have disappointed us today .
well , we &apos;d better go to a comedy next time .
i don &apos;t want to watch a tragedy until we have finished the journey .
i thought the musical comedy we saw last week before we started the trip was very good .
it was .
yeah , they had constant changes of scenes , and i love variety .
me. too .
i hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one act after another . i was tired of that .
another reason might be that the lines are to difficult for us to understand .
sometimes the body language is easier to understand for foreigner .
the charms of drama depend as much on the action as the words .
i quite agree with you there .
we have a popular saying in our country : &quot; all work and no play makes jack a dull boy . &quot;
we all believe that every body needs recreation .
we cannot work all the time if we want to maintain good health .
you &apos;re quite right !
i think everyone has his own way of relaxing .
perhaps the most popular way is to participate in sports .
when i was young , for recreation , i liked to play tennis in the summer .
my favourite winter sport was skiing .
you also have a favourite sport , don &apos;t you ?
yes , my favourite sport is badminton .
sometimes , i also play table tennis , or go swimming .
many people enjoy sporting events , but they do not like to participate in them .
chess , card-playing , and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by people old and young .
are you a good dancer ?
not quite .
at my age , i like to jogging .
i think it is a very good exercise .
it &apos;s a pity i haven &apos;t had much time for exercise lately .
i &apos;m afraid i am putting on weight .
that serves as a timely warning !
you must try your best to reduce weight .
would you like to go the movies , mr. hunt ?
what &apos;s on now ?
is there something good ?
look at the newspaper .
there is a western on at the people cinema . here it is .
the frontier .
oh , i have seen it . are there any typical chinese movies ?
yes , there are many .
do you care for a kung-fu movie ?
what do you mean by kung-fu , mr. wang ?
kung-fu is a kind of traditional chinese martial arts . it &apos;s different from boxing .
i see .
when i was a small boy , i watched a chinese television serial . there were many kung-fu shots in it .
perhaps the name of that serial was huo yuan jian .
i can &apos;t remember .
it was wonderful .
i haven &apos;t seen such movies for years .
i often see a romance or science fiction . and today i &apos;d like to have a change .
let &apos;s consult the newspaper for such a film . here at the globe movie city a very popular film by the name of challenger is being on these days .
the box office of the movie is said to have broken the record of its kind in hong kong .
who plays the hero , a chinese or a westerner ?
of course , a chinese , zhou runfa plays the leading role .
i &apos;ve never heard of him .
but he is very popular with chinese . he &apos;s established his fame in hollywood , too .
if you could only see some of his movies , you &apos;d like him .
when shall we see the movie challenger ?
here is the timetable .
it &apos;s up to you .
would you like to see the movie expectation ?
it &apos;s new one , i suppose ?
you bet .
the heroine is played by nancy keller .
good .
she is my favorite star .
i must go and see it .
will you go with me ?
i will .
what did the review say about it ?
not too bad .
the critics in new york times said it was rather light and colorful and entertaining .
movie news gave it three stars .
but mind you , you can &apos;t always rely on the reviews .
we &apos;ll have a better idea after seeing it ourselves , don &apos;t you think so ?
yes , i guess you &apos;re quite right .
i &apos;ll get the tickets reserved at the box office .
why not call the box office to book the tickets ?
it can save you a lot of trouble .
but i don &apos;t know their number .
i suppose we can find it in some local newspapers .
let &apos;s look at new yorker . here it is . 287-3122 .
what time is convenient for you ?
7 : 30 suits me fine .
then you just wait for me here , and i &apos;ll come and pick you up at 7 : 00 .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ll be expecting you .
goodbye .
many people say hollywood is a city of glamour , especially to those star struck teenagers .
i was born and brought up in hollywood . i &apos;ve seen hollywood grow to what it is today .
yes , it &apos;s the place i love best .
the constant sunshine and mild climate of southern california made most of my time happy and made hollywood an ideal place for shooting pictures .
have you been in the movie line ?
yes . almost forty years . first as an actor then a director .
and i am now a photographer , touring around the world .
do you think hollywood is so much a center of the world movies as before ?
movies were first made in hollywood before world war i.
its fame and fortune reached its peak in the 1930s and 1940s , the golden days of black and white movies .
nowadays many cities are well developed in the most prominent movie city .
i hear india produces almost as many movies as america , but american movies are still the most influential in the world .
yeah .
things are changing . maybe someday xi &apos;an or sydney will take the place of hollywood .
nobody knows .
hollywood is not only famous for its movies , is it ?
producing movies is only an industry of hollywood .
you know about 80 percent of all american tv television entertainment comes form hollywood .
i didn &apos;t know that .
it is also famous for its music .
hollywood bowl , the huge outdoor amphitheater , is very attractive .
every summer &quot; symphonies under the start &quot; are played by america &apos;s best orchestras before packed audiences .
my next stop is hollywood .
i think i &apos;ll know more about movies there .
have a nice trip .
goodbye .
shall we go to movie tonight ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
what &apos;s on ?
gone with the wind .
what &apos;s it about ?
sorry , i &apos;ve no idea .
i thought this movie should be a candidate for some film awards .
if i &apos;m not mistaken , it has already won an oscar .
really ?
i &apos;m not surprised.the camera work was very good and the scenery was beautiful .
i thought the acting was first rate , too .
would you like to go to a movie with me tonight ?
yes .
is it an american movie or a foreign movie ?
american .
then i &apos;d like to go .
hello , jack !
hello , smith !
have you just been to the cinema ?
yes , i have .
did you go alone ?
no , i went with jane .
what &apos;s on ?
&quot; gone with the wind &quot; .
oh , it &apos;s an old film .
i &apos;ve already seen it .
i saw it long , long time ago .
it is a famous film .
yes , the acting and the story are excellent .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
according to the poster put up near the booking office of the cinema , another famous old film will be shown this coming sunday .
what is it ?
&quot; the sound of music &quot; .
oh , that &apos;s another famous film !
i saw it about 15 years ago when i was working in new york .
i &apos;d like very much to see it once again !
i &apos;ve also seen it before .

what &apos;s on ?
&quot; gone with the wind &quot; .
oh , it &apos;s an old film .
i &apos;ve already seen it .
i saw it long , long time ago .
it is a famous film .
yes , the acting and the story are excellent .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
according to the poster put up near the booking office of the cinema , another famous old film will be shown this coming sunday .
what is it ?
&quot; the sound of music &quot; .
oh , that &apos;s another famous film !
i saw it about 15 years ago when i was working in new york .
i &apos;d like very much to see it once again !
i &apos;ve also seen it before .
i was deeply impressed by the story and the music of it .
shall we go to see it again together ?
that &apos;s great !
well , i &apos;ll book the tickets for both of us .
very good .
oh , how frightening , please turn off the tv , john .
why ?
i don &apos;t want to watch such horrible movies . they give me nightmares .
mary , they are just stories .
what do you think about this week &apos;s tv series ?
eh , to tell you the truth , i don &apos;t think much of it .
what &apos;s your favorite tv program ?
actually i like variety shows better .
i also like variety show , but that depends on the host or hostess .
i agree .
if a host lacks humor , i would rather see none .
what &apos;s on channel three at eight o &apos;clock ?
the tv series &quot; a dream of the red chambers &quot; .
it &apos;s a satellite tv program .
what is it about ?
it tells us a tragic love story of jia baoyu and lin daiyu in ancient china .
it sounds like a chinese story of &quot; romeo and juliet &quot; , i should say .
the film &quot; gone with the wind &quot; will be on channel twenty tomorrow evening , vivian leign is a very famous actress .
her performance is wonderful .
the actor clack gable is excellent too .
it &apos;s worth seeing .
don &apos;t miss it .
all right .
i won &apos;t .
i am so excited to attend a typical chinese concert .
so am i.
the first item is chinese musical instrument ensemble , including such masterpieces as the night of spring flowers , river , and moon .
the night of spring flowers , river , and moon is one of the most wonderful wonderful pieces i &apos;ve ever heard .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
it praises the picturesque landscape of china .
what else ?
the moon reflected in the twin ponds . that &apos;s an erhu solo . butterfly lovers . that &apos;s violin concerto . and some other popular folk music and songs .
the concert of the chinese folk music masterpieces must be impressive .
how many kinds of traditional chinese music instruments are there ?
i don &apos;t know exactly , but i &apos;m sure there are at least 300 kinds . they can be grouped in four categories : stringed instruments , plucked instruments , percussion instruments and wind instruments .
you must be proud of that .
yes .
a chinese wind instrument , called &quot; sheng &quot; was introduced to persia and later to europe .
i hear there are over 50 nationalities in china .
i think they each have their unique music , don &apos;t they ?
yes . you are right .
take the dai nationality for example . their taigu is terrific .
oh , the concert begins . really wonderful .
what &apos;s that horse-head like instrument ?
that &apos;s the horse-head fiddle of the mongolian nationality . its music is rather moving .
is there a solo of that fiddle ?
i &apos;m afraid there isn &apos;t .
what a pity !
excuse me .
can i help you ?
i am a tourist from china . my name is zhang feiyue . you play the violin quite well .
thank you . nice to meet you .
my name is robert johnson .
call me robert .
i want to enrich my musical knowledge during the trip to vienna .
can you give me some suggestions ?
you know vienna is a city of music .
you might hear mozart , schubert , beethoven , strauss , or haydn at an opera house , a church , or an open-air performance .
i am a fan of mozart .
you &apos;ve landed in the right city .
in this city steeped in musical traditions and institutions , you &apos;ll only be able to hear his music in the concert halls , but also visit the places in which he lived and worked .
i hear mozart memorial is the place musical lovers frequent .
yes , it &apos;s not very far from here .
you just walk along the street . turn right at the corner . then walk two blocks and you &apos;ll there .
walk along the street and turn right at the corner . then mozart memorial is only two blocks away .
that &apos;s right .
to a true viennese , a meal is not a meal without music .
many restaurants provide customers with wonderful music as well as terrific cuisine .
last night i did hear some first-rate musical performances at a restaurant called &quot; wiener &quot; .
wherever you go , you can enjoy the charms of music .
that &apos;s true . thank you for your suggestions .
wish you happy music tour in vienna . goodbye .
the symphony orchestra we &apos;re going to hear tonight is one of the best in europe .
the playbill says that the fist selection is beethoven &apos;s symphony no. 6 in f major , commonly know as the pastorale .
are you familiar with this piece ?
no , i afraid not .
there &apos;s a commentary about it in the program.you can read it if you like .
thank you .
oh , there &apos;s the conductor .
the concert will begin soon .
i can &apos;t stand modern music .
you mean debussy , ravel , and those composers ?
no , i mean new rock , jazz and the like .
why don &apos;t you like it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it makes me nervous just to listen to it .
how beautifully they played !
i enjoyed every minute of it .
me , too .
i had thought i wouldn &apos;t understand it , but when i heard the music i loved it immediately .
i reckon they played the beethoven best .
i agree .
i think it was a very good performance .
how about you ?
i enjoyed it very much too . i especially liked the piano concerto .
yes.the pianist was marvelous .
i wonder where he studied ?

how about you ?
i have a special liking for orchestral music .
how do you like the rest of the programme at the concert last night ?
i liked the tenor solo fairly well .
the quartet was not half bad , either .
there was a special item on the programme . _ _ _ _ american popular music .
what do you say to that ?
american popular music does not appeal to me .
but , so far as i know , it is played all over the world and is enjoyed by people of all ages in many countries .
i wonder why it enjoys such great popularity .
the reasons for its popularity are its fast pace and rhythmic beat .
i confess that las vegas is beyond my imagination .
the world is brilliant !
do all the hotels have their own casinos ?
yes , of course .
then , how many hotels are there in las vegas ?
i don &apos;t know , either .
i have never counted them .
now , what kind of gambling can we play here ?
anything you like .
such as roulette , blackjack , craps , baccarat , keno , slot machine and so on .
frankly speaking , i have never experienced gambling before .
what may be the most popular type of gambling that a beginner can enjoy ?
slot machines seem too easy . well , how about roulette ?
you have only to put out your tips or cash on the number you &apos;ll be at first .
how can i get those tips ?
the dealers can exchange your dollars for casino tips .
shall we go ?

mr. stone has felt a slight pain in his back for a few days . he goes to see dr. wang in the hospital .
good morning . mr. stone .
good morning . dr. wang .
sit down . please . what seems to be the trouble ?
well , doctor , i &apos;ve had a dull sort of pain in my back for three days . and it got worse this morning when i was exercising .
where exactly is the pain ?
i can &apos;t quite pinpoint it .
when i sit or stand in a fixed position for a long time , i feel a dull pain across my back . but it doesn &apos;t seem to bother me when i &apos;m lying down or in a relaxed position .
when did you first notice the pain ?
about a week ago or so . i &apos;d been sitting for a long time , talking with a business friend . when i stood up afterwards , i felt the pain .
do you remember straining your back in any way during the past two weeks ?
not that i can remember .
i played basketball a couple of weeks ago , but i don &apos;t &apos; think it could be that .
have you picked up or moved anything heavy ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
all right . let me have a look .
could you take off your coat and shirt , and lie on the couch , please ?
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s pneumonia , do you ?
i &apos;ll give you a checkup .
i can &apos;t give you a definite answer until i see the results .
do you have any fever ?
how about your appetite ?
no , i don &apos;t have any fever , and my appetite &apos;s quite healthy .
now , breathe deeply and exhale slowly . once more , please . there is no respiratory murmur in your lungs . now does it hurt when i press here ?
no .
how about here ?
yes , that hurts .
was it a sharp or a dull pain ?
oh , it was sharp , not the usual type of pain i &apos;ve felt recently .
all right . you can put on your shirt and coat now .
what seems to be the matter , doctor ?
well , judging from the checked-up , it may be a slightly strained muscle .
do you play basketball ?
i used to play quite a lot , but recently i &apos;ve been too busy to play .
you said you played two weeks ago .
yes , that was the first time in a long while .
i think that &apos;s where the trouble stems from .
do you really think so ?
do you remember feeling stiff after that game ?
let me see . yes , i did feel a bit of pain in my back the next morning .
but anyone has sore muscles when he exercises for the first time after a long break .
yes , that &apos;s true .
but you might have hurt yourself during the game , and not noticed at that time .
so , what can i do about it ?
i &apos;ll give you a prescription for some pills to relieve the pain , and you should stay off work for 3 or 4 days , and not lift any heavy objects .
you could try some massage .
it &apos;s usually quite effective at relieving pain like this .
there is a very good massage department in our hospital .
i heard there are a lot of top masseurs in china .
i &apos;d love to try it .
fine .
there &apos;s a well-know masseur in this hospital . i &apos;ll give him a call and ask him to take care of you .
thank you very much , doctor .
good-bye .
not at all . good-bye .
what seems to be the trouble ?
i feel sick all the time .
any vomiting ?
no .
then i suggest you go to gynecology for further examination .
what &apos;s the trouble ?
i &apos;ve been losing sleep .
is it troublesome ?
it &apos;s getting more and more so .
you look rather pale .
i think i &apos;ve caught a cold .
take these pills and try to rest as much as possible .
thank you .
doctor , what &apos;s this for , can you tell me ?
this will relieve your pain and subdue this inflammation .
i see .
thank you .
remember , this solution is for external use only .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i have a headache and a sore throat .
how long have you had that problem ?
for about three days .
is there anything else that bothers you ?
i perspired a little last night .
and i &apos;m feeling dizzy now .
well , i think you &apos;ve caught a bad cold .
what &apos;s her problem ?
she has been throwing up since yesterday evening .
she seems weak and she can &apos;t keep down anything she has a stomachache and a sight fever .
i see .
let me feel her pulse , and take her temperature .
now i &apos;d like to check her blood .
is it serious ?
no . she should rest for about a week .
i &apos;ll prescribe some medicine .
is it necessary to follow a special diet ?
yes .
she should eat some light food .
scene 2 in the consulting-room
what &apos;s the matter with you , mr. sun ?
i have a headache , a sore throat and a cough .
and i had a terrible stomach-ache early this morning .
open your mouth wide , please .
i just want to have a look at your throat . say &apos; ah &apos; .
ah .
hm , it &apos;s red .
let me examine your chest .
just unbutton your clothes , please . now , take deep breaths . inhale . exhale . inhale . exhale that will do , thank you .
i &apos;ll give you some pills and tablets and a cough mixture .
here &apos;s the prescription .
take the medicine every four hours .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll feel better tomorrow .
now let me take an x-ray photo of your stomach .
follow me , please !
scene 3 another day in the consulting-room
well mr. sun , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
my ulcer has been worrying me lately , and i want to know the result of the x-ray of my stomach .
do you have a pain in your stomach ?
yes , particularly after meals .
i vomited blood yesterday .
do you often do it ?
no , i &apos;d never done that before .
i see .
let me see your x-ray result .
holds the negative plate against the light
mm .
i thought so . mr.
mr. sun , i &apos;m afraid you need an operation for the ulcer .
is it so serious ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
operation !
what about my heart ?
let me feel your pulse .
have you been weak lately ?
yes , i get tired rather easily .
have you been losing any weight ?
i suppose so .
the mirror tells me that .
has anyone in your family got heart trouble ?
well , both my parents have high blood-pressure , and my grandfather died of a heart attack .
hm .
your heart is in a rather bad state .
i &apos;m sorry to say you my need another operation someday .
you mean i should have two operations ?
yes , very likely .
otherwise you &apos;ll go on suffering from these complaints for the rest of your life .
let me think it over , doctor harrison .
when i &apos;ve made up my mind , i &apos;ll come again .
i feel ill .
what &apos;s the trouble ?
i &apos;ve got a sore throat and it hurts to swallow .
i think you need a shot to relieve the pain first .
by the way , i advise you to give up drinking and smoking .
how do you feel ?
i don &apos;t feel like eating anything . i feel like vomiting .
how long has this been going on ?
for two days .
i &apos;m feeling rather out of sorts today.my belly hurts .
are your bowels regular ?
no .
i &apos;ve had two more movements this morning .
there &apos;s a bad virus going around there and maybe that &apos;s the cause .
i hear a roaring in my cars and i feel giddy .
how long has this been going on ?
a week .
keep warm , drink plenty of hot water and get plenty of rest .
doctor , this tooth often gives me pain .
it will have to be taken out .
let me give you a needle to numb the tooth .
is it very painful to have it taken out ?
no .
i suggest you have your appendix removed .
what should i do to get better soon ?
don &apos;t overdo things , and try to stay in bed for a few days .
thank you , doctor .
what &apos;s the trouble ?
i had to be out all afternoon yesterday on account of some urgent business although i had a cold .
when i came home after stopping for supper on the way , i had a headache and fever and a pain in the chest .
in fact i was in aches and pains all over , so i took some aspirin and went straight to bed . during the night my stomach began to ache and i felt like vomiting , i could get no sleep at all .
oh , let me see .
has the pain in the chest anything to do with the upset stomach ?
no , it has nothing to do with it .
let me feel your pulse .
open your mouth and let me see your tongue , please .
do you still have a stomach- ache ?
it &apos;s a little better than this morning , but it still aches .
undress and lie down here .
your throat is quite swollen.you have a touch of flu .
i &apos;ll give you a penicillin shot .
there &apos;s nothing seriously the matter with your stomach.so you don &apos;t need to worry about that . i &apos;ll give you a prescription . take the liquid medicine three times a day thirty minutes before meals and the capsules a half hour after meals .
now then , i must warn you against greasy food for a while . for two or three days eat only soft food such as soft boiled eggs , oatmeal , milk and toast bread .
after that you may eat what you like , but don &apos;t overeat for a while even if you have an appetite .
all right , doctor .
thanks .
i keep feeling dizzy , and i &apos;ve got a headache .
how long has this been going on ?
it came on yesterday .
i should say you &apos;re generally run down .
what ought i to do ?
i &apos;ll give you something for it , and come to see you in a couple of days .
i &apos;m running a temperature , and i feel sick .
since when have you been feeling like this ?
it all started the day before yesterday .

about 3 days .
my tooth hurts , doctor .
i can &apos;t bite down because of the pain .
when did it start feeling like this ?
two days ago .
you don &apos;t have a fever , do you ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
then we &apos;d better take an x-ray first and find out what &apos;s wrong .
doctor , whenever i cough , my chest hurts .

a high-quality mechanical watch will last longer , but you have to wind it up every day .

yes .
jingdezhen is know as &quot; the capital of porcelain &quot; .
i wish to pick some spoons and bowls .
many foreign guests come to buy this kind of porcelain . we call it &quot; mi kong hua &quot; or &quot; rice pattern &quot; .

good afternoon .
what can i show you ?

i &apos;m at your service .
chinese arts and crafts include many kinds , like sandal wood fans , cloisonné articles , carved works , woven wares , bamboo-work , porcelain , traditional chinese paintings , ink slabs , ink brushes , and so on .
thanks a lot .
i &apos;m especially interested in traditional chinese paintings . can you show me the good ones ?
yes .
look , this an imitation of the famous painting &quot; spring outing &quot; by zhan zhqian , who was a great artist of the sui dynasty .
this &quot; galloping horse &quot; was also painted by him . wasn &apos;t it ?
no .
it is a reproduction of xu beihong &apos;s world-famous painting .
mr. xu was one of the greatest painters of modern china .
wonderful !
the horse looks so life-like .
how do you like them ?
very much .
i &apos;ll take the reproductions of &quot; spring outing &quot; and &quot; galloping horse &quot; .
how much do you ask for the two reproductions ?
30 dollars for the reproduction of &quot; spring outing &quot; and 200 dollars for the reproduction of &quot; galloping horse &quot; .
the price is reasonable .
here is the money .
thank you for coming .
good afternoon , sir .
may i help you ?
good afternoon .
i &apos;m a tourist from america .
during my stay in beijing , i saw the chinese people are very fond of fans , not just for their handy cool practicality , but also for their aesthetic beauty .
now , i &apos;d like to buy some for myself .
can you give me some suggestions ?
with pleasure .
traditionally , fans are made of gauze , palm , feathers , wood , even ivory .
but it is the hand-painted paper and silk fans that are considered the most valuable .
yeah , the paintings on the fans are very beautiful .
since song dynasty , the official-gentry class has amused themselves by writing poems and paintings by celebrities have been regarded as gifts to friends and relations .
can you show me some silk fans with paintings ?
certainly .
but we have many types : round , square or shaped-like a leaf .
which style do you like best ?
i like round ones best .
here you are .
i &apos;ll take the two fans with &quot; a pavilion in rain &quot; and &quot; the eight immortals crossing the sea &quot; respectively .
besides , give me some fans without paintings on them , please .
as i &apos;m a painter , i want to paint some pictures on the fans myself .
that &apos;s a good idea .
may i ask what you want to paint ?
i &apos;ll paint what i have seen in china , of course , the things impressing me most .
good .
they will be significant and valuable fans .
thank you .
good afternoon , what can i do for you ?
i &apos;m looking for the counter which sells tooth paste .
right here .
i &apos;ve run out of my tooth paste this morning .
i need to buy a can of tooth paste .
we have many kinds of tooth paste , which would you like to buy ?
can you recommend some to me ?
sure .
the famous brands are &quot; hei mei &quot; , &quot; liang mian zhen &quot; , &quot; blue sky &quot; and so on .
which is the best ?
it &apos;s hard to say which is best . each kind has its own features , and each person has his own like and dislikes .
if you like the scent of spearmint , you may take the &quot; blue sky &quot; tooth paste .
this is what i want .
give me a can , please .
a big can or a small can ?
a big can .
how much does it cost ?
two yuan and sixty fen rmb .
will you please pay at the cashier &apos;s desk ?
ok . thanks a lot .
welcome to our department , sir .
can i be of any assistance .
i want to buy some razor blades .
we have razor blades made in shanghai and imported from italy and england .
show me the razor blades turned out in shanghai .
here you are .
are they any good ?
certainly , sir .
they are made by a well-known factory .
you can see the blade bears the marker &apos;s stamp .
why are you so sure that they are of high quality ?
they are made from selected laboratory-tested steel and each blade is separately tempered , honed , and hair tested by hand .
that sounds good enough .
i &apos;ll take one set .
do you want to see anything else , miss ?
i want to buy some soap .
we have perfumed and unscented soap .
let me have a look .
we have a lot of them . do you have any one in mind ?
no .
these are the kinds of perfumed soap we have . which brand do you prefer ?
actually , i &apos;ll be giving them as a present to the newlyweds .
look at this piece , please . it is &quot; lux &quot; brand with gentle skin conditioners . it is popular with young people .
the scent smells good .
i &apos;ll have 8 pieces of it .
why are you buying eight pieces ?
nowadays , chinese people think the number &quot; eight &quot; is the symbol of god luck , because its pronunciation is close to &quot; fa &quot; in chinese which means fortunate .
oh , i see .
shall i gift-wrap them ?
yes , please .
where shall i pay ?
at the cashier &apos;s desk . just follow the arrow , please .
thank you very much .
see you again .
good-bye !
excuse me . can you help me ?
certainly .
i &apos;m cooking for detergent .
what brand would you like to buy ?
i don &apos;t know which one is best .
which one would you like to recommend ?
why not try using &quot; panda &quot; brand of detergent ?
it is super concentrated powder . it is quite popular and sells a lot .
can you tell me its characteristics ?
with pleasure .
firstly , the fabrics washed with it feel fluffy and soft , esp. for synthetic fibred fabrics , and it prevents static electricity and reduced electric spark and dust .
secondly , it has the features of low foam , hard water resisting and readily rinsing , the cleaning strength redoubles .
thirdly , it is applicable to washing fabrics , such as , cotton , linen and synthetic fibre , etc .
by the way , could you tell me how to use it ?
yes , twenty-five gram is enough for a washing-machine per batch . the volume of it for hand washing is equal to 1 / 4 of the ordinary ones .
besides , when using , pay attention to dissolving the powder completely and soak the clothes before washing . rinse clothes once or twice after washing .
thank you for your information .
give me one kilogram , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
it is sold by a keg .
a plastic keg holds 2 kgs .
how much will it be then ?
20 yuan rmb .
i &apos;ll take a keg of it .
is there anything else ?
no . thank you .
that will be all for today .
good , morning , madam .

no .
i wish to buy handkerchiefs for my son .
we have a wide selection of handkerchiefs for you to choose from , and we &apos;ve just got in a new batch of printed handkerchiefs .
oh , wonderful .
show me some , please .
we &apos;ve printed handkerchiefs with flower designs , birds , beauties , little animals and so on .
by the way , how old is your son ?
he is only five years old .
your son must be fond of the printed handkerchiefs with little animals , i think .
you are right , your are more a psychologist than a saleswomen .
my son likes animals so much that we are raising a cat and a dog at home for him .
we have been taking him to the zoo once a month since he was three years old .
you &apos;d better take more handkerchiefs with small animals , not only for his using handkerchiefs but also for his enjoying the small animals .
that &apos;s a good idea .
let me look at the handkerchiefs with small animals .
ok. here you are .
what lovely small animals !
look , this panda is embracing bamboos . that cat is rolling a boll .
there are still dogs , lions , tigers , monkeys , elephants , zebras , bears , .. i like the handkerchiefs very much , let alone my son .
how many handkerchiefs would you like to buy ?
a dozen .
but be sure they are of different patterns .
certainly .
it comes to six yuan .
i &apos;ll give you a key chain with a small rabbit without charge . since we have the policy - - buying one , getting one free .
thanks a lot .
see you later .
see you later .
are you looking for some crème , madam ?
yes , i want to see about them .
great .
in order to allure more customers , we &apos;ve stocked all types of crème .
there are many choices .
which one are you interested in ?
what &apos;s brand of this one ?
this is &quot; evolution &quot; produced in france .
how about it ?
it is a night crème and a kind of biological treatment .
with revitenol . and it &apos;s rich and creamy in texture . this moisturizing , firming and nourishing formula helps your skin to flight against any chances that come with aging . it can be alone or after intensive extract with revitenol .
it sounds terrific .
and how about that one ?
you mean this one ?
no , the smaller one , next to that one .
fine , mam , this is &quot; oil of moisture protection creme &quot; .
it &apos;s a selling crème at present time in our shop .
just as what is said in the ad : it can give the extra care and protection .
is that true ?
certainly , mam . because its special moisture binding system works like the fluids in your skin to lock moisture into your skin , it meet your skin needs to restore and maintain its natural moisture balance , leave your skin feeling softer , smoother , and make you noticeably youthful as well .
well , my goodness .
i really don &apos;t know which one is better to take , they are both marvelous .
let me think it twice .
oh , mam . an ounce of practice is worth a pound of theory , so i suggest you buy one kind between the two brands .
great ! you take the words out of my mouth , i have set my mind on this one &quot; oil of moisture protection creme &quot; .
you have really good taste on crème .
you will get what you pay for .
thank you very much .
thank you mam , drop in anytime please .
can you help me , miss ? i want to buy a kind of mousse .
great , mam . which one do you like best ?
i don &apos;t know from adam , because i have never used it before .
can you recommend anything ?
ok. mam .
here are many choices . but among them , the ador and mingxing styling mouses can be called the best .
they are home-made and high-quality products .
ador mouse is a unique product which provides lasting style with a natural look . and it is to provide flexible hold and control , without stiffness or stickness too .
is it a light airy product ?
yes , it is .
it is light so that you can use it after every shampoo .
well . how about the mingxing one .
its function is the same as that of ador .
but one distinctive difference between them is that mingxing styling mousse contains chinese herb which can help mend your damaged hair .
are you clear , madam ?
yes . i &apos;m as clear as crystal .
thank you for your recommendation .
may be , i think the mousse of mingxing brand is suitable for me , because my hair quality is not good enough .
it needs special care in some way .
you want to take it .
yes , i take it .
but can you please tell me how to use it ?
no sweat !
before you use it you should shake it first , then point it vertically down wards and squeeze a small amount of foam on your palm , while spreading it evenly through the hair , finally , you can comb your hair and style it as you like .
thank you .
i catch on it .
ok .
how much is it ?
22 . 5 yuan rmb .

yes , i &apos;m looking for a wedding ring for my financee .

oh , congratulations !
would you like to have a gold ring ?
these are rings of 18 and 24 karat gold .
i don &apos;t want to buy a gold ring . a year ago , i gave her an engagement ring of 24 karat gold .
how about this ring ?
it is a diamond one inlaid with 18 k gold .
don &apos;t you think it very attractive ?
it &apos;s very nice .
is it ruby ?
yes .
ruby is the most precious of precious stones .
this kind of ring is one of our best-selling items .

how do you sell it ?
sixty-five yuan per metre .
by the way , is the colour fast .
i &apos;m not quite familiar with chinese silk .
no. it is the finest chinese silk .
the brand has gained good reputation all over the world .
mn . , is it washable ?
most of the chinese people wear it just indoors , so it seldom needs washing . but once you wash it , you must be very careful .
you can &apos;t rub it as you do with other cloth .
o. k.
i &apos;ll buy it .
anything else ?
no .
thank you very much .
don &apos;t mention it .

what &apos;s the price for this heater ?
it seems i &apos;ve never seen this kind before . is it a gas water heater .
a gas water heater .
it &apos;s been on sale just for one week .
what features does it have , i wonder .
it is manufactured with technology , apparatus and productions facilities imported from japan .
it is high quality product with sophisticated design and fine finish .
but exactly in what way is it different from other types .
it has good combustion power . it &apos;s heating efficiency is 85 % . carbon monoxide power . it &apos;s heating efficiency is 85 % . carbon monoxide content is below 0.01 % . besides it s equipped with automatic flame extinguishing safety valves-in case of fire . the safety values will automatically shut off the gas passage within the shortest possible time to prevent gas leakage .
it sounds terrific .
could i have a look at the instructions myself .
sure .
how long is the warranty on it ?
we have one-year warranty .
should any manufacturer &apos;s defect occur , we will replace it without any charge .
well , i think i will take it .
good morning , sir .
can i be of any assistance to you ?
yes , thank you . please show me a video made in japan .
what about the one displayed in the window ?
it &apos;s the latest model . as far as i know it is only on sale here is beijing .
oh , it &apos;s look is superb . but i want to know in what way it differs from the ordinary videos .
it &apos;s called camcorder or the 3dcam .
it uses two separate &quot; microcamera &quot; lenses to shoot two pictures at the same time on vhs-c video-cassette type .
each of the two cameras serially records 60 pictures per second . when the tape has been completed , the recorded three-dimensional images can be reproduced on a tv screen using a standard vcr .
images can also be replayed directly from the 30-cam to the television .
well , it sounds fantastic .
if you see feature films , you must wear special glasses to see the 3-d images - in this case , liquid- crystal . this glasses are connected by an adapter to the vcr or the 3d-cam ..
can you show me how to handle it ?
ok .
wonderful it is .
but i figure , it must be quite expensive .
you have got it .
it &apos;s 11200 yuan fec . almost twice or even 3 times as much as ordinary ones .
but you &apos;ll get your money worth in the long run . because it may replace the old type ones in the near future .
in that case i &apos;ll take it . i &apos;d like to pay with credit card . is that ok ?
certainly , sir . can you sign here ?
could you give me a receipt ?
certainly sir . here you are .
we have a new line of toy telephones that have just arrived .
would you like to get one for the children at home ?
i do have to buy some toys for my nieces and nephews .
yes , can i see them ?
yes , we have a discount on these items . ten percent off the newly arrived toys and fifteen percent off on the older ones .
ok .
i &apos;ll take two of these and another two of those .
can you suggest a toy for a twelve-year-old girl ?
how about some dolls ?
girls that age are especially fond of them .
she &apos;s already got plenty of dolls . i &apos;d like to give her something different this time .
maybe some model ships with remote control .
yes , sir .
what make do you want ?
american , if there are any .
you might like this one .
this looks nice , but there is a blemish on the right side .
i &apos;ll bring you a new one . please wait .
will it take long ?
just for a little while .
all right .
here it is .
this looks better .
i &apos;ll take it .
where do i pay ?
step this way , sir . good day .
thank you . please look in again whenever you may be passing .
can i help you with something ?
i &apos;d like to buy a woolen sweater for my wife .
but i have the faintest idea of what to buy since there are so many sorts to choose from .
what do you suggest for it ?
how tall is she ?
she &apos;s 1 . 62 metres tall but fairly slim .
oh , see the girl in red ?
they are similar in build .
what colour is her skin ?
a little bit dark .
but no darker than i &apos;m .
if i were in your shoes , i &apos;ll choose a bright sweater . how do you find that one ?
it &apos;s knitted by hand with mohair from australia .
can you take it down to let me have a look .
of course .
you can feel it with your hand .
it feels so smooth and soft .
what a splendid pattern .
it shapes like a rabbit . you know she happens to belong to the year of rabbit .
so it must be to her liking if you buy .
in fact we only have several of this style .
1 , 518 yuan fec .
maybe it &apos;s a little expensive but in terms of its unique style , it &apos;s worthwhile to buy , ..
i don &apos;t care about price as long as it is pleasant to my wife &apos;s eyes .
could you have it gift-wrapped ?
certainly .
before i forget , here is a bottle of complimentary wool softening conditioner . it &apos;s specially made for washing the sweater of this kind .
thank you .
here is the money . keep the change .
receipt , please .
by the way , we &apos;ll have a sweater week next week , hope you and your wife come .

do you know the size in inches ?
no , i don &apos;t .
but when i buy shoes in america , i take size 6 .
well , ma &apos;am , the simplest thing to do is to measure your foot .
would you mind sitting down ?
not at all .
oh , i see .
you take a size 22 according to our measurement system .
i believe we have your size .
just a moment , please .. here you are .
but i don &apos;t think i care for this color .
do you have the same size and design in black ?
yes . here you are , ma &apos;am .
would you like to try them on ?
i &apos;d like to .
oh , they are too big .
but they seem to be a perfect fit .
i know .
but i always buy my shoes a size smaller .
they stretch , you know .
i &apos;ll show you shoes of a size smaller . try them on , please .
mm . they are quite satisfactory to me . i &apos;ll take them .

thank you for your purchase .

yes .
i want to buy a suitcase .

this style , a medium size , please .
are they all made of real leather ?
no . some are made of artificial leather , and some are of real leather .
how about this one ?
it &apos;s of real leather .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too small .
then i &apos;ll show you a larger size . is this ok ?
thank you . let me see if it can hole all the stuff in the two gags .
a single suitcase is easier to handle than two bags .
that &apos;s true .
please try .
oh , it &apos;s so spacious . i &apos;ll buy it .
and i &apos;d like to see some wallets .
what size ?
here is a very popular one .
have you got smaller one ?
i think it &apos;s too big .

i &apos;ll take it . how much are they altogether ?
300 dollars .
here you are .
good evening , ma &apos;am .
may i help you ?
i &apos;m trying to find hat for myself , but i haven &apos;t decided which one to take . for there are so many styles .
that &apos;s true .
may i recommend this one ?
as for its design it &apos;s acceptable , but its color ..
we have a dozen colors for this style-black , pink , blue , navy , red , purple , orange , gray , yellow , almost every possible colors except green .
why not green ?
i prefer green to any other color , especially for my hat .
as you know , ma &apos;am , different nations have different preferences and abhorrences .
some chinese tend to associate green hats or green scarves with the loss of their spouse &apos;s love .
thus , few manufacturers supply green hats or scarves .
i see .
maybe i have little hope to avail myself of a green hat in china .
cheer up , ma &apos;am .
it suddenly occurs to me that the tristar store is selling green hats , but i don &apos;t know whether you can find a satisfactory style there .
thank you so much .
by the way , where is tristar ?
2 people road .
i know where the people road is .
wish you good luck .
goodbye .

i like this one .
here you are .
this model is quite popular . this sample is the last one we have in stock .
how much is it ?
40 dollars .
can you lower your price a little ?
i &apos;m afraid we can &apos;t .
our prices are non-negotiable .
but look !
the shaver is scratched here .
yes , that &apos;s the case .
let me consult the director .
sorry to have kept you waiting .
i &apos;m glad to tell you that the director has agreed to allow you a 20 percent discount .
20 percent ?
still it &apos;s beyond what i can accept .
how about half the price ?
are you kidding , sir ?
i &apos;m sorry 20 percent is the farthest we can go .
this shaver work very well . it &apos;ll be worth every penny you pay .
moreover , the scratch is not conspicuous .
so 20 percent discount can more than compensate its defect .
excuse me . where is the ladies &apos; dress section ?
it &apos;s right in front of the elevator on the sixth floor .
thank you very much .
have you been taken care of ?
no , i am at a loss for the size .

it seems you &apos;re interested in this dress .

that &apos;s no problem .
it is made of linen , so you won &apos;t feel hot in it .
i can assure you it wears well and keeps its shape .
that &apos;s nice , but i don &apos;t like the collar .

no , thank you .
these with paintings are especially to my taste .

you are really thoughtful . here you are .

i want a curtain .
here you are .
it is not long enough . bring me a larger size , please .

no , they are made of stainless steel .
but they look a bit too dull .
i think you &apos;d better show me something silver-gilt .
hello ?
good morning , this is nancy of white rose products company .
i know you &apos;re busy , but i &apos;d appreciate having just a few minutes of your time to let you know about our new fall products .
okay .
have you ever bought white rose products before ?
no , but my sister has . she &apos;s always saying how good they are .
good . i &apos;m always happy to hear about a satisfied customer .
i guess you &apos;re somewhat familiar with our product line then .
yes , i have a pretty good idea of what you carry .
well , we &apos;re adding several new products this fall .
we have a new moisturizer coming out , that is moisturizer and sunblock in one . it &apos;s hypo-allergic and it is available in different formulas to suit all skin types .
okay .
may i ask what type of skin do you have ?
it tends to be rather oily .
well then , you might benefit from our new foundation make-up . not only is it oil-free , it also works to cut down oil on your face and it won &apos;t clog your pores .
do you still offer facial masks ?
yes , we have , egg-white and several types of fruit masks depending on your skin type .
actually , we &apos;ve just added a new mint mask to our line which would be good for your skin type .
do you have anything else that is new ?
we &apos;ve also introduced some new shades of lipstick and eyeshadow .
i think i &apos;d like to try that new mint mask .
okay . i &apos;ll put you down for one .
can i get your name and address , please ?
my name is paula kern and my address is flat 3 a , to li terrace , pok fu lam .
okay . miss kern , your order will go through today and your mask should arrive within two weeks .
i &apos;ll send you our catalogue along with your order so you can see what else is new and have a look at those new shades of lipstick and eyeshadow .
sounds good .
thank you for time ! have a great day !
good morning , i &apos;m liz hui of real beauty products company . i &apos;m promoting our new line of products and i am wondering if you &apos;d like some free samples ?
sure , why not ?
we have several different products that just came out this fall , today i &apos;m just promoting three , but here &apos;s a copy of our catalogue to give you a better idea of the different types of products we sell .
thank you .
one of our new products is an oil-free moisturizer . it &apos;s hypo-allergic and won &apos;t irritate even very sensitive skin .
it feels really nice on the skin . a lot lighter than my regular moisturizer .
the moisturizer is available in two different sizes , one is one hundred milliliter , the other is two hundred and fifty milliliter .
i &apos;ve started using this new kind as well . i found it a lot better for my skin than my old product .
we also have a new kind of foundation . the effect is lasting .
oh , i need new foundation . how much is it for a bottle ?
a thirty-millilitre bottle is one hundred and twenty dollars .
we also have a larger size , forty-five-millilitre , which runs at one hundred and sixty dollars a bottle .
i &apos;d really like to try some of this foundation . i really like it .
okay , we &apos;ll just figure out your skin tone and i can give you one right now .
thank you .
good morning . what brings you here today , mrs. white ?
i &apos;d like to buy a jumper for my daughter .
how old is your daughter ?
she is going to be eight this sunday .
happy birthday , miss .
thank you .
how do you like these ?
i was thinking of something much brighter .
then , how about these ?
yes , those will do .
let me take a closer look .
the material is very good and it &apos;ll last a long time .
how about the handiwork ?
are you sure it is made well ?
boys and girls are apt to tear their clothes , you know .
you can see the seams are doubly sewn .
they are really meant for the rough and tumble .
it looks fine enough .
but you &apos;ve got to do some work on the length of jumper .
yes , they can be taken off an inch or so .
well then , give me three of these .
hello . do you need any help ?
my boy would like some school shirts .
do you have them in stock ?
certainly , madam . we make a specialty of children &apos;s wear , and have a large variety of them in stock .
nothing too expensive , please .
david is a growing boy . so he won &apos;t have those clothes for long .
i understand .
i think i have what you are looking for .
will these do ?
ok .
why don &apos;t you put it on , david ?
is there any difference between ready-made dresses and dresses made to order ?
certainly , there is .
dresses made to measurements stand a little higher in price , but they are fitted to the body , and are much more carefully finished .
we give them to our best hands to be made .
how much difference are we talking about ?
around 25 to 30 percent more perhaps .
oh , that &apos;s a bit over my budget .
that &apos;s alright , miss . there are perfectly beautiful dresses in our collection you can try on .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
i &apos;m looking for something white .
i &apos;ll be wearing it at a wedding party .
how about this one ?
it &apos;s a little bit too revealing .
do you have anything else ?
how about this one ?
that seems alright .
would you mind if i try it on first ?
no , go ahead .
the fitting room is right over there .
my friend is looking for a gown .
can you show us some ?
certainly .
we have the best gowns in town .
yes , we want it for a special occasion .
it &apos;ll be the anniversary of our parents and we &apos;d like to look our best .
yes , i see .
what kind may i show you , cotton , linen , gabardine , woolen , or nylon ?
a cotton fabric will do .
come this way , please .
do you have this style in yellow ?
surely , miss . here you are .
may i try it on ?
the fitting room is over there .
thank you .
may i help you ?
that &apos;s alright . i &apos;m just browsing around .
if you should need some help , just call , i &apos;ll just be around .
thank you .
later
excuse me , how much are you selling these books for ?
that &apos;s four dollars and ninety-five cents times the present exchange rate .
i guess this is not an illegal reprint .
no , it &apos;s not .
is this the last copy you have ?
just a moment . let me check .
i &apos;m sorry but that &apos;s the last one .
i can give you a discount on it , if you want .
ok . i guess i don &apos;t have much of a choice .
i need this badly .
are you being served , sir ?
i &apos;d like to buy a medium-sized vase with a light blue background .
i &apos;m sorry , sir . they are sold out .
we only have some big ones now , but we are expecting to have some tomorrow .
oh , i am leaving america tomorrow .
i don &apos;t think i have much time .
could you go to the friendship store and get it there ?
let me see .
how much is the big one ?
one hundred and eighty dollars .
that sounds reasonable .
will you show me some ?
yes , sir .
how would you like this one ?
the background is pale blue with traditional japanese paintings of flowers and birds .
it &apos;s attractive .
i &apos;ll take a pair .
i am sure my wife will like them .
yes .
i &apos;m sure she will , sir .
can you pack the vases and send them to beijing by mail for me ?
yes , sir .
please write your name and address on this slip .
ok . how much should i pay then ?
four hundred dollars altogether , including the postage and the charge for the packing .
you know , we &apos;ll have to make a special box .
all right .
here &apos;s the money .
thank you .
good morning , madam .
can i help you ?
yes .
i bought this sheet here yesterday .
anything wrong with it ?
yes .
when i spread it out back home , i found this hole .
oh , how awful !
may i have a look at the receipt ?
here it is .
well , please accept our sincere apologies .
i &apos;ll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
that &apos;s very kind of you . thank you .
my pleasure .
we &apos;re sorry that this has happened , and i guarantee that the same mistake won &apos;t happen again .
can i help you , sir ?
yes , i want to buy a sheet for my daughter .
i hope i can find a pattern she loves .
i see .
how old is she , may i know ?
6 years old .
all right .
we have a wide selection of sheets ; for example , checked , flowered and dotted ones .
yes , these designs are quite unique , but do you have some kind with animals ?
my daughter loves animals very much .
yes , we do . please come over here .
i &apos;ll spread this one for you to have a good look at .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
oh , what lovely little animals !
i &apos;m sure my daughter will like it .
i think so , too .
can you suggest a toy for a little girl ?
how about some dolls ?
girls are especially fond of them .
but she &apos;s got plenty of dolls .
i &apos;d like to give her something different this time .
maybe some model airplane kits .
yes , madam . which country do you want ?
american , if there are any .
you might like this one .
this looks nice , but there is a blemish on the left wing .
i &apos;ll bring you a new one . please wait .
will it take long ?
just for a little while .
all right .
here it is .
this looks better . i &apos;ll take it .
where do i pay ?
step this way , sir .
goodbye .
thank you .
please look in again whenever you may be passing .
can you suggest a typical japanese toy for my son ?
he is six .
what do you think of this big teddy panda ?
panda ?
wonderful !
my son likes pandas very much.he will surely be interested .
can you show it to me ?
here it is . isn &apos;t it lovely !
yes . let me see how it works , will you ?
certainly .
it is a battery- powered.so i &apos;ll try it out for you .
there &apos;s nothing to that , you see .
what kind of battery does it use ?
ordinary ones are ok . but i think you &apos;d better use nicad batteries , because ordinary ones last only four hours for continuous use . if you use nicads , they can b recharged again and again .
ok . i &apos;ll take your advice .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry we don &apos;t have this kind of camera in stock .
will you be having any more in ?
i doubt it , but you might be lucky at our branch in the international commercial building on dennel road .
would you please tell me the way to get there ?
certainly .
you can take bus no. 21 . the bus-stop is just across the street .
where should i get off , please ?
dennel road stop .
after getting off , turn back and walk ahead . when you come to the crossroad , turn left and walk up along dennel road to 875 . you can &apos;t miss it .
you were really helpful . thank you very much .

well , japan and china is the cradle of silk fabrics .
ok .
please give me two metres .
yes , madam .

er , i wonder if the silk piece &apos;s color won &apos;t go off .

we have some wonderful ties just in from europe .
their designs are extraordinary . the color is well blended with taste .
you could get them in harmonizing or contrasting colors .
every one is a piece of art .
don &apos;t you think they &apos;re very attractive ?
yes . how much does such a smashing tie cost ?
$ 238 .
oh , that &apos;s too much .
but sir , look at quality , the design , and the coloring .
tremendous work and effort have gone into every tie .
every tie , as i have said , is a piece of art , not mass-produced .
yes . they do look good , quite unusual .
all right , i &apos;ll have the blue one with yellow and pink circles .
is there anything i can do for you ?
yes , please . i like the style of the cardigan very much , but the colour is not my preference .
we &apos;ve got three colours here . they are red . yellow and light blue .
haven &apos;t you got any brown colour in stock ?
sorry , we haven &apos;t at present , but the new order is coming soon . perhaps next week .

good morning , miss .
good morning .
i want to buy a swimming suit .
we have a fresh stock of all kinds of swimming suits . i &apos;m sure you can find a satisfactory one .
yes , i hope so .
i &apos;ve been visiting many big stores , but i haven &apos;t found my favorite yet .
do you like this one ?
it &apos;s the latest fashion , very popular .
but don &apos;t you think the design is a bit too complicated ?
then how about this one ?
the pattern is vivid and great and matches your slender figure .
you will surely look wonderful in it .
thank you . that seems to be what i &apos;m looking for .
good evening , madam .
good evening .
would you please show me some black shoes ?
all right .
how do you like these in the showcase ?
they look very nice .
let me try this pair on .
may i ask what size you wear ?
36 , please .
they seem to be a bit too tight . they pinch .
maybe these are the right size .
yes , but they are too narrow .
i want wider shoes .
how &apos;s this pair ?
umm . this is a comfortable fit .
how much is it ?
$ 128 .
all right . i &apos;ll take it .
may i have a look at the cushion cover ?
yes , please .
how do you sell them ?
we sell them by set . it &apos;s ninety dollars per set .
oh , that &apos;s kind of steep .
it is still the preferential price .
can you show me something cheaper ?
yes .
what about this machine-woven one ?
it is fifty and five dollars per set .
may i help you ?
yes . have you got table cloths here ?
yes , we have . but i wonder which do you prefer , the hand-woven or the machine-woven ?
what &apos;s the difference in the prices between the two kinds ?
of course .
these hand-embroidered ones are all first class goods . they are more expensive than the machine-woven ones .
although the machine-woven table cloth is much cheaper , i don &apos;t like it .
so , have a look at the hand-embroidered one .
what fine needlework !
what does it cost ?
ninety dollars and twenty cents .
can you give discounts ?
that &apos;s our rock bottom price .
i &apos;d like to buy this hand-made rug . how much do you ask for it ?
72 dollars .
oh , i didn &apos;t expect it be so expensive . i haven &apos;t got enough american currency . could i pay by traveler &apos;s checks ?
of course .
the rate for traveler &apos;s checks is rmb 835 yuan against $ 100 .
here are two 500-yuan checks . i think it &apos;s enough to pay for the rug and i &apos;d like to change the rest into american dollars .
have you got your passport with you ?
yes . here it is .
would you please sign the checks and memos ?
thank you . here is your passport , memo and american money . please double-check them .
hello .
champion sporting goods .
what can i do for you ?
i bought a pair of shoes at your store yesterday , but it &apos;s too large for me .
have you worn it yet ?
no .
bring it back and we &apos;ll exchange it for a smaller size .
can i get a refund ?
only if you still have the receipt .
i have the receipt .
bring it back anytime , then .
thanks a lot .
good-bye .
bye .
here &apos;s your change , sir . see if it &apos;s all fight .
oh , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve given me ten more yuan .

i &apos;m glad to have been of some assistance .

see you later .
what can i do for you ?
i want to find something typically chinese to decorate my room .
how about this artistic tapestry and this cloisonné vase ?
well , i &apos;m looking for something a little different .
these teapots are beautiful . the colour is similar to that of my sitting room .
no , they are made of clay .
they are yixing purple clay teapots .
this kind of tea ware is very famous in china .
ah , i see . how can i make tea with this teapot ?
that depends on what kind of tea you want to make , the chinese tea is classified into green tea , white tea , oolong tea , black tea , pu &apos;er tea and scented tea .
what kind of tea do you like ?
well , i am a little familiar with black tea . can you show me how to make the tea ?
i &apos;m sorry to say we do not have any tea in this shop , but i can tell you the steeping method . first , put the tea leaves into the pot , then put hot water into it , the amount of tea in proportion to water is 1 to 9 .
the temperature of the water is 100c . after 10 seconds , the tea will be ready .
ah , i see .
what is the price of this tea set ?
it is 600 yuan .
that s too much , i &apos;ll take it if you give me a 50 % discount .
well , i can just take 100 yuan off the price .
all right , i will take this set .
any thing else for you ?
yes , what is the design of this paper cut ?
they are lotus flowers .
ah , how beautiful !
how much is it ?
it is 20 yuan .
i will take it , can i have it framed ?
i want to hang it up in the bedroom .
yes , but you will have to pay for the frame . it is 30 yuan .
all right . here is the money . it is 550 yuan altogether .
thank you .
would you give me a shopping bag ?
yes , here you are .
good morning , sir .
anything i can do for you ?
i &apos;d like to buy a sweater .
here are some latest styles . are you interested ?
i like the design . do you have any red ones ?
yes .
just a moment . here you are .
can i try it on ?
certainly .
over there is the mirror . do you think it ok ?
everything except the color .
do you have a lighter red ?
the dark red doesn &apos;t fit my complexion .
yes . here are three red ones in different shades .
this color is just what i &apos;ve been expecting .
i &apos;ll take this one .
medium size ?
yes , the same as that one i tried on .
how much is it ?
567 yuan .
i &apos;m pleased that you like it .
thank you .
good afternoon , sir .
can i help you ?
i hear chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . i &apos;d like to take some home .
we have various kinds of articles , such as the tri-colored glazed pottery of the tang dynasty , embroidery , brocade , jade carvings , wood carvings , bamboo carvings , lacquer ware , braiding , etc .
i want something typically chinese and easy to carry .
well , the tri-colored pottery is beautiful , but it &apos;s fragile . cloisonné is heavy and can be easily damaged .
i suggest you buy some embroidery . it &apos;s easy to carry .
i &apos;m interested in it . it looks delicate .
here is a piece of su embroidery .
let me see it .
oh , a dog &apos;s playing with two balls .
the dog is so cute . how much is it ?
500 yuan .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too expensive .
too expensive ?
feel the material . look at the pattern .
aren &apos;t they excellent ?
excellent as they are , they can &apos;t be worth that much .
this morning a peddler showed me a piece of su embroidery . the pattern was great . he only asked for 300 yuan .
did you take it ?
yeah , i took it for 250 yuan only . here it is .
they are quite different .
yours machine-made , i mean it is mass produced . it isn &apos;t worth that much . at most it can sell 150 .
you were overcharged .
really ?
but look at all the embroidery i &apos;m dealing in . they are all hand-made . both sides display the exactly same pattern . it &apos;s worth every penny i asked for .
how about 400 yuan ?
500 yuan is the lowest i can accept .
i know some foreigners never bargain , so i &apos;ve never over-priced my goods . you can compare mine with other sellers .
then you &apos;ll find 500 yuan is quite reasonable for such an excellent item .
ok , i do love it . i &apos;ll take it .
here is the money .
thank you .
excuse me , miss . would you please do me a favor ?
wait a second , please . i &apos;ll be right over .
what have you decided on , madam ?
i &apos;d like to buy a coat like the one on the model beside the door .
you really have good taste , madam .
this came from japan just the other day .
what color do you prefer ?
the grey one looks nice , so does the beige one .
which do you think suits me better ?
well , i think beige goes well with your complexion .
you may try it on . the mirror is behind you .
thank you .
this color is quite attractive , but does it fade ?
no , it doesn &apos;t .
this kind of material has been treated by means of a new technology , so it is colorfast .
then i &apos;ll take this one .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
good-bye .
bye-bye .
may i help you , madam ?
yes .
it &apos;s my first visit here . i want to buy some things for my daughter .
but i &apos;ll catch my plane in three hours . i &apos;m afraid i haven &apos;t got enough time to do the shopping .
would you mind doing me a favor ?
certainly not .
what are you thinking of buying ?
i want to buy some silk and perfume .
and i have to change some money first . where &apos;s the foreign exchange desk ?
on the second floor , madam .
the escalator is over there . follow me , please .
thank you .
my pleasure .
here &apos;s the silk counter .
oh , how beautiful !
i &apos;ll take two scarves for my daughter .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll like them . them . they are nice for gifts .
now , let &apos;s go to the cosmetics counter , shall we ?
ok .
my daughter &apos;s asked me to buy her a typical american perfume .
what would you recommend ?
dream paris perfume is elegant in smell and the fragrance lasts long . it must be a good choice to buy dream pairs .
all right , i &apos;ll have a bottle .
thank you .
you are welcome .
oh , what time is it now ?
don &apos;t worry . we have at least two hours to go . anything else ?
no , thanks .
can i get a taxi at the gate ?
sure .
i &apos;m going to get one for you . this way , please .
it &apos;s very kind of you . i really can &apos;t thank you enough .
don &apos;t mention it .
you would have done the same in my position , i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my duty .
and how wonderfully you performed your duty !
how much should i pay for this lotion ?
30 dollars .
by the way , what else would you like , sir ?
well , what kind of perfume do you have ?
we have both american and western perfume . which do you like better ?
american , please . i want to get one bottle for my girlfriend as a souvenir gift . please show me something of good quality .
how about this chif perfume ?
it has won national super-quality certificate . it &apos;s advertised on tv , very popular .
really ?
what makes it so special ?
the elegant smell . it &apos;s just the thing that would take a lady &apos;s fancy .
then i &apos;ll get a bottle . how much is it ?
108 dollars . so the total is 138 dollars .
here you are .
thank you .
anything else ?
nothing more , thanks .
how much is it altogether ?
let &apos;s see what that &apos;ll all cost . 25 dollars for this lipstick . 36 dollars for the face powder , 18 dollars for the perfume . so add up to 79 dollars .
here you are .
well , a one-hundred-dollar note . 79 dollars form 100 dollars leaves 21 dollars .
see if it &apos;s all fight .
exactly .
here is your receipt and change .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
the sign says you &apos;re having a sale right now .
that &apos;s right . can i help you with anything ?
i &apos;m looking for a rice cooker .
do you have any in this store ?
why yes .
come with me , please .
these are really cheap .
but is it automatic ?
certainly , when the heat comes to a certain degree , a red light will go on and the electricity will be cut off automatically .
do you have a warranty on this one ?
yes , we do .
it &apos;s good for one year .
everything seems ok .
i &apos;ll just have lunch and i &apos;ll come back for it later .
won &apos;t you buy it now ?
no , i never make purchases at first sight .
that &apos;s ok .
whatever will suit you .
thanks .
thanks for coming .
hello , is mr. thomas show here ?
yes , i &apos;m thomas show , can i help you ?
i &apos;m mary of the local branch of microsoft . i come here to discuss how you can make better use of computers in your business .
would you mind if i come in and talk to you for a few moments ?
of course not , come on in .
you own a home-based catering business , right , mr. show ?
yes , that &apos;s right .
do you have a computer now ?
yes , i got it several years ago .
it &apos;s a 586 processor .
what sorts of software do you use on it ?
well , i use a spread-sheet programme as well as a word processing programme , but i know they &apos;re both pretty old and outdated .
have you considered upgrading your system ?
yes , but i &apos;m not sure what exactly i would need .
have you considered adding a painting programme to your software ?
it would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . you can even make your own business cards with some programmes .
that would be a definite bonus .
you might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now .
you &apos;d probably want more hardware and ram , a faster modem , and a faster processor . do you have a cd-rom drive ?
no .
you might want to add a cd-rom drive , because most new software programmes are coming out on cd .
this sounds great , but how much would all this cost me ?
probably less than you think because you have all the basic components already .
if you like , i can have a look at your computer and then check out some prices for you and make up an estimate .
okay , that would be nice .
come into my office and i &apos;ll show you my computer .
any thing can i do for you , madam ?
yes , please .
i &apos;m here to order a pillow for my new bedroom .
very good , madam .
what pattern do you have in mind ?
we have a variety of patterns .
how about showing me some samples ?
right over here , madam .
please take your time to choose your favorite .
this one looks quite good . is it made of cotton ?
yes , and the hem is made of satin .
ah , just what i &apos;ve been looking for .
how much would a pillow like this cost ?
well , the cost of the material will come to 250 dollars .
and what is your charge for the tailoring ?
100 dollars . so the total is 350 dollars .
all right . i &apos;ll give you the order .
thank you , madam .
now tell me the sizes , please .
i &apos;ve written everything on this piece of paper .
good .
when will it be ready ?
in about one week , madam .
that &apos;ll be fine .
here &apos;s a deposit of 100 dollars . i &apos;ll pay you the remainder when the pillow is ready .
thank you very much , madam .
if you &apos;ll wait one moment , i &apos;ll make out your receipt .
can i help you ?
i &apos;d like to buy some american cakes .
we have cream birthday cakes , ten dollars each .
do you like it ?
fine . give me two cream birthday cakes .
all right .
well , will you wrap them up separately ?
certainly .
any thing else ?
nothing more .
how much altogether ?
twenty dollars .
here are twenty-one dollars .
one dollar for me ?
oh , no. we don &apos;t accept tips .
but thank you all the same .
ok .
good-bye .
good-bye .
please step in again .
good afternoon , sir .
what can i do for you ?
good afternoon , miss .
i &apos;d like to change some u.s. dollars into fec .
well , can you tell me what today &apos;s exchange rate is ?
certainly , sir .
according to today &apos;s exchange rate , every u.s. dollar is equivalent to 5.79 yuan fec .
how much would you like to change , sir ?
i want to change 500 dollars and here is the money .
would you please fill out this form ?
all right .
please write down your name , and passport number on the slip .
my name is alan crook and my passport number is ..
here you are .
thank you .
wait a minute , please . you &apos;ll have it right away .
well , would you sign your name here on this memo ?
ok .
i want to have some small change , would you give me some one-yuan notes ?
of course , sir .
here it is , please have a check and keep the exchange memo .
thanks a lot , miss .
oh , by the way , can you tell me what i should do if the fec is left when i am about to leave .
you &apos;ll have to go to the bank of china or exchange office to change it back .
i see .
thank you for you help .
you are welcome .
we are always at your service .
bye !
bye !
here you are .
the receipt is in the bag .
thank you .
i &apos;ve never seen a doll like this in beijing .
my little girl will she ?
how old is she ?
she just turned six .
she &apos;ll start elementary school next spring .
oh , does school start in autumn in beijing ?
yes . i heard it starts in september in the u.s. right ?
how did you find that last lot of marmalade ?
oh , excellent .
but one or two buyers said the marmalade might be a little too sweet .
i see .
and the canned peaches , what about them ?
ah , that &apos;s a different story .
the taste of the peaches is fine ; but as you know , appearance counts in canned foods .
without any doubt , appearance comes before price .
how could the canned peaches be improved ?
i recommend a pleasant color and no mess .
where &apos;s the mess , exactly ?
in the syrup , or in the peach halves ?
customers have told me that hollow of the peach halves , you know , the inside of the peach , should be clean cut ; that is to say , no fibers or pulp remaining .
aren &apos;t they supplied that way now ?
no , many consignments are not .
are these goods needed urgently ?
not urgently .
we want to be able to release them in our market , say , three months from now .
then , i &apos;ll have a talk with one or two of our makers .
they &apos;ll be in to see me sometime this week .
what else have you got outstanding besides these piece goods ?
the made-up goods for europe , and the rayon scarves for southeast asia .
well , the last lot of scarves , after we took the delivery , we heard of a competitor getting similar scarves from the same maker only at thirty dollars per dozen .
really ?
we &apos;ll look into that . might have been a question of quantity again .
anyway , we &apos;ll see what the makers have to say about this .
well , that &apos;s about all for the present .
we may have some more business for you before long . let &apos;s hear from you about market conditions from time to time .
certainly . i &apos;ll let you know what &apos;s going on .
good morning , sir .
can i help you ?
i hope so . i &apos;d like to make a complaint .
i bought a rather expensive cardigan from you last week .
is there anything wrong with it ?
oh , my goodness !
the cardigan was not only completely ruined but also ruined a large number of expensive clothes .
oh , dear !
that doesn &apos;t sound too good .
no , it certainly doesn &apos;t .
the day before yesterday , i was walking in the cardigan and it started to rain .
the color ran .
i could see the dye dripping from it . the dripping dye ruined my trousers , shirts and vest .
oh , how awful !
i hang it to get it dry , and the following morning , it was about half the original size .
for cardigans of this kind , you have to stretch them carefully before drying them .
i did try to stretch it carefully and also i saw what happened . all the buttons were off .
but did you use excessive force , sir ?
i certainly didn &apos;t. why are you so bossy ?
perhaps you could show me the cardigan in question , sir .
yes , of course .
here it is .
i &apos;m afraid , sir . i don &apos;t think you could have bought it here .
mmm ?
you see the label is .
that label ?
the original label had come off .
i mean , obviously you &apos;ve been trying to cheat me by putting on your fancy label on a cheap mass-produced article .
i can assure you , sir , that we have the highest reputation for both quality and honesty .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;ve never been insulted like this in all my life . i shall draw my custom .
good morning , sir .
i &apos;d like to speak to the manager .
i am the manager , madam .
how can i help you ?
it &apos;s this radio . it doesn &apos;t work .
mm . did you buy it here ?
of course .
look , you switch it on and nothing happens .
could i see your receipt ?
receipt ?
i haven &apos;t got one .
oh , you should have obtained a receipt when you bought it .
i probably did . i might have thrown it away .
ah , well , have you got any other proof of purchase , the guarantee , for example ?
no .
it must have been in the box . i threw that away , too .
oh , dear .
you really ought to have kept it .
and did you check the radio before you left the shop ?
no , it was in the box .
i expected it to work . it wasn &apos;t a cheap radio . it &apos;s a good make .
you should have checked it .
please stop telling me what i should have done , and do something , either give my money back or give me another radio .
there &apos;s no need to get aggressive , madam .
let me look at it .
umm . you see this little switch on the back .
yes ?
it &apos;s on &quot; mains &quot; , and it should be on &quot; battery &quot; .
you really should have read the instructions .
can i have a tax-refund form , please ?
i &apos;m from china .
sure .
by the way , where can we get back the duty paid ?
at customs of any european union countries .
excuse me , could you help me ?
yes .
what seems to be the problem ?
well , i was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport .
i &apos;m afraid not .
have you lost your passport ?
i think so .
i can &apos;t fink it anywhere in my hotel room , and i remember the last place i used it yesterday was in this department store .
where exactly did you use your passport in the store ?
in the shoe department .
i had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler &apos;s checks .
well , let me call the shoe department to see if they &apos;ve found a passport .
a minute later
sorry-your passport &apos;s not been turned in there , either .
then what shall i do ?
you can fill in this lost property report , and i &apos;ll keep my eye out for it .
those kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but i suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn &apos;t show up .
you &apos;re right .
do you have a pen ?
here you are .
oh , i seem to lose something every time i travel .
i put in two fives for a coke , but nothing came out of the machine .
really ?
let me check the machine .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s broken .
no , sir . i &apos;m afraid you put in one five and a one-dollar coin .
anything else , sir ?
that &apos;s all for now .
how much do i owe you ?
that &apos;ll be fifty-five dollars and thirty cents .
can &apos;t you make it a little cheaper ?
just a moment .
i &apos;ll talk to the manager .
sir , we can give a 15 % discount .
oh , good !
thank you .
what can i show you ?
i &apos;d like to see some handbags .
here you are .
how much is this ?
i must say you have good taste .
this one costs only one hundred dollars .
oh , it &apos;s too expensive .
please give me a discount .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t reduce the price .
excuse me , but please change this .
why ?
there is a crack .
can i have it replaced ?
let me see .
and here is a stain .
i &apos;ll change a new one for you .
can i get a refund for this ?
of course .
can i help you , sir ?
yes , you can . i bought this china vase at this store yesterday , but when i opened the box back at my hotel , i found this crack in the bottom .
let me have a look at it .
well , we will gladly give you another , sir .
please accept my sincere apologies .
that &apos;s fine .
excuse me to interrupt you .
how can i help you
yesterday i came here and bought this flash lamp .
did you ?
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
actually nothing wrong .
but when i got home , i found it didn &apos;t fit in with my camera . i wonder if i could have my money back .
do you have any proof that you bought it here ?
yes . here &apos;s my receipt .
well , i can &apos;t decide myself . please wait a minute . i &apos;ll have to ask our counter manager .
thank you .
all right , our manager has agreed to give your money back .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
can you make this dress into a skirt ?
i &apos;d be glad to do any alteration for you .
thank you very much .
this shirt doesn &apos;t button up very easily .
well , this button should be moved an inch higher .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
some slight alterations will have to be made on be suit , i &apos;m afraid .
all right , we &apos;ll see to it .
surely you can reset the collar .
no problem .
i want you to fix it for me .
what was the dress you wanted me to fix for you ?
this overcoat needs to be taken in a bit .
we can reset the seam and take in some of the material .
could i have this skirt altered , please ?
yes , we &apos;ll shorten it for you .
i &apos;ll leave all that to you .
all right , we &apos;ll see to it .
do you think you can let it out a little ?
we can let it out a bit .

in two days .

i can change the neckline .
when would you like to pick it up ?
how about friday ?

i &apos;m here to try my dress on .
here is your dress .
please try it on .
it &apos;s a little too tight around the waist .
can you do anything about it ?
we can let it out a bit .
this skirt &apos;s so full it makes me look like a balloon !
yes , this skirt needs taking in at the waist .
would you please also take the skirt up a little bit ?
sure , of course .
would you make me an overcoat out of this heavy woolen cloth ?
yes , of course .
please make it single-breasted .
ok .
do you have some good woolen fabrics ?
yes , we do .
i &apos;d like to make a suit out of this woolen fabric .
it wears well and keeps its shape .
would you show me some patterns ?
here you are .
and there &apos;re some samples in the show window , too .
i &apos;d like my coat lined with fur .
no problem .

act three
at the airport hotel
li li comes up to the receptionist &apos;s desk .
the man who is standing behind the counter receives her with a charming smile .
good evening , madam !
what can i do for you ?
good evening !
a single room for one right , please .
have you booked it ?
no .
what kinds of single rooms are available ?
there are luxurious suits , ordinary rooms and economical rooms .
an economical one will do for me ; i &apos;m a student , you see .
but all the economic rooms are at the top of the hotel , on the 9 th floor .
would it be o.k. ?
i think so .
there are lifts going up and down in this hotel , i suppose ?
yes , there are two lifts at both ends of the corridor .
that &apos;s fine .
the higher up the room is , the better it will be .
you &apos;ve said it , madam .
it &apos;s quieter there ; you can hear the traffic .
and i should think you get more fresh air up there .
is there a telephone in the room ?
sorry , there isn &apos;t one , not in any of the economical rooms , but there is a fairly large black-and-white . t.v. set .
i &apos;ll check in .
here is my passport ; when you do the registration , you can copy my name and all the other things you want to know from the passport .
it would save time .
mm . i can see you are a very smart young lady .
but pardon me , madam , to you mind filling the blanks in the register-book yourself ?
i &apos;ll check with your passport after wards .
don &apos;t you think that would be even quicker ?
yes , perhaps that would be a quicker way .
it shows you are smarter than me , anyhow .
thank you for you compliment , madam .
not at all .
there &apos;s yet another way : supposing you do the registering with the help of my passport , since you know what items should be entered in that big book , and let me do the checking afterwards , since i know more about myself than you do .
surely that &apos;s the quickest and the best way .
o.k !
you &apos;ve won .
he pushes the book towards li li .
there &apos;s no need now .
i did the checking when you were copying from my passport .
now you see why i told you it would be the quickest way .
now i see why i &apos;m told the chinese are most clever .
well , here &apos;s your passport , and the key .
your room number is 918 .
you &apos;d better go up by the lift at that end of the corridor . it &apos;s nearer to your room .
thank you .
do you want to be called up in the morning ?
yes , please .
just call me at 7 o &apos;clock tomorrow .
what &apos;s time for breakfast in this hotel ?
breakfast is served any time between 7 and 9 : 30 .
would you like to have breakfast in your room ?
you can have it sent to you , if you like .
no , thank you .
i &apos;m sure it would cost more .
i &apos;d rather have my breakfast in the dining-hall .
where is it ?
it &apos;s on the ground floor .
you understand me , don &apos;t you ?
i mean this floor-that &apos;s the british expression .
but the americans call it &quot; the first floor &quot; .
we do the same in chinese .
anyway , the dining-hall is on this floor .
if you go to the other end of this lounge and turn to the right , you &apos;ll find it .
the door faces the souvenir store ; you won &apos;t miss it .
thank you .
i &apos;ll come to check out soon after breakfast tomorrow .
now i must book a plane ticket before i go up to my room , as there is no telephone there .
may i use this one here ?
yes , do !
could you tell me the phone-number of the booking-office ?
of course .
this is the airport hotel , so you only have to dial the extension number .
it &apos;s 101 .
thank you .

we have a change machine right over there . you can get change for a one , five , or even-ten-dollar bills .

ah , just like las vegas , huh ?
any chance i &apos;d get more quarters out than i put in bills for ?
i wouldn &apos;t count on it .
the washing machines are easy to use .
first , you select your temperature , add your laundry , then place your quarters in the slots , put it in right there , and that starts the machine .
that seems easy enough .
but what about the soap ?
watch the lights on the machine .
when the detergent light goes on , and detergent .
when the bleach light goes on , add bleach .
and just wait until the machine is finished .
where can i get detergent and bleach ?
we have a vending machine right over there that takes quarters .
you can get a box of detergent and a box of bleach for only fifty cents .
i really appreciate your help .
my pleasure .

no , madam .

it &apos;s unusual . we do try to check the rooms as thoroughly as possible .
just one pillow , was it ?
is there anything else ?

what can i do for you ?
yes , i &apos;d like to change some dollars .
how much would you like to change , sir ?
i &apos;ll change 500 dollars .
please fill in this form .
all right.thanks.
is there anything i can do for you , sir ?
yes .
it is the first time i have come to america .
i don &apos;t carry checks but only some cash.would you mind changing it into checks for me ?
certainly .
thank you very much indeed .
don &apos;t mention it .
can you change some dollars for me ?
sorry .
i have no small bills .
that &apos;s all right .
you can go to another store for them .
thank you anyway .
hi . i &apos;d like to cash an american express traveler &apos;s check .
sure .
would you please sign your name on the back , sir , with your passport number ?
and i &apos;ll need to see your passport .
sure .
can you give me twenty dollars in small bills , please , and ten dollars in change ?
no problem .
here &apos;s your passport , and here &apos;s your money .
have a nice day , mr. yu .
hello , ma &apos;am .
good afternoon .
what can i do for you ?
can i have the laundry done today ?
certainly , sir . can you fill out the laundry form first , please ?
ok . here you are .
that &apos;s fine .
thank you .
by the way , where is your laundry ?
here in the laundry bag .
any more ?
yes .
well , i want to have a suit dry-cleaned .
i have an important dinner to attend at 6 o &apos;clock this evening . do you think i could have it back before then ?
let me see .
it is two now and there are still four hours to go .
i think you can get it back in time .
our special laundry service can do it in less than three hours .
how much do you charge for the special laundry ?
in addition to the normal charge , there is a 50 percent extra charge .
that sounds reasonable as long as you can get my suit cleaned and sent back to me in time .
no problem .
laundry service .
can i help you ?
yes .
i want to have a dress washed , but i &apos;m afraid it might fade .
there shouldn &apos;t be any problem , ma &apos;am , but you will need to write down special instructions on your laundry list .
i also have an evening dress that is torn .
you might ask the housekeeping clerk to mend it for you .
or if you have us wash it , you can write in the laundry list , &quot; the evening dress needs both washing and mending . &quot;
that &apos;s a good idea .
i have two blouses . one needs to be washed and the other needs to be dry cleaned .
does the tag on the one for dry cleaning say , &quot; dry clean only &quot; ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it shouldn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;ll be very careful .
just put the one for dry cleaning on your dry cleaning list cleaning list and then put it , together with the dry cleaning list , in the dry cleaning bag , not the usual laundry bag .
thank you for giving me so much information .
is there anything else i can help you with ?
i think that &apos;s all for now .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to know your laundry service hours .
if your laundry is received before 11 : 00 a.m. , we &apos;ll deliver it to your room by 9 : 00 p.m. the same day .
for more information , please dial 8 and you &apos;ll get housekeeping .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to have this laundry done .
could you fill out the laundry form ?
ok .
by the way , i want to have this sweater washed by hand in cold water . it might shrink otherwise .
by hand in cold water . i understand .
excuse me . have you any dirty laundry ?
i have some .
please leave it in the laundry bag .
the laundry woman comes over to collect every morning .
thank you .
please tell me whether you need your clothes ironed , washed or dry-cleaned and also what time you want to get them back .
i want it dry-cleaned and ironed .
if you can make it , i &apos;d like it back this evening .
no problem .
good-bye !
i have a silk dress which i think its color will run in the wash .
we &apos;ll dry-clean the dress . it won &apos;t run .
when can i have my laundry back ?
in about two days .
can i choose express service ?
certainly .
but you must be charged 50 percent more for express .
all right .

tian &apos;anmen square is one of the largest square in the world . many great historical events happened there .

it &apos;s on the north of tian &apos;anmen .
until 1911 the palace was off-limits to ordinary citizens , so is also known as the forbidden city .
it was constructed in a fourteen-year period during the 15th century .
twenty-four emperors lived and ruled there for almost 500 years .
you mean it can tell me 500 years of chinese history ?
you &apos;re quite right .
another place well worth visiting is the summer palace .
it is a grand park of historical importance .
you can also learn something about the chinese history there .
i &apos;ll include it in my sightseeing list .
just now you mentioned a temple . what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s the temple of heaven .
it has the largest group of temple buildings in china . this building complex ix noted for is exquisite layout , harmonious color , and unique structure .
my wife specializes in architecture .
i want to be more knowledgeable about this field . the trip to the temple of heaven might be a good education .
i hope so .
what about the fragrant hills ?
the fragrant hills is a park located several miles west of here . it &apos;s famous for its red leaved in autumn .
it &apos;s good place for sightseeing , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
and the great wall is a place appealing to both chinese and foreigners .
i &apos;ve been there .
i went there on my first business trip although i was very busy .
it is said that the great wall is one of few man-made wonders people can see with the naked eye from the moon .
it &apos;s wonder of the would arc architectural history . why not go there again to enrich your knowledge in architecture ?
good idea !
i &apos;ll visit it again .
what a huge museum of the terra-cotta army !
it was built in 1979 , 230 meters long , 72 meters wide , and 22 meters high . it houses over 6 terra-cotta warriors and horses .
it &apos;s a mighty army . what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s the reviewing stand .
marching in the front are 3 ranks of vanguards . each rank has 70 warriors .
and behind them is the main body of the army ?
that &apos;s right .
the warriors and chariots are placed at regular intervals .
there are 38 files , each 180 meters long .
the warriors o both sides of the army body are quite different . they all face outside . why is it so ?
most of the terra-cotta warriors here face the east because the state of qin was located in the west .
the first emperor fought eastward to unify china .
the soldiers on both sides of the main army body are flanks . their task was to guard against enemy attacks and outflanking , so they face outside . and there is another array of warriors at the rear .
they also face outside .
what a mighty battlefield !
were they arranged in the same manner looked when is another array of warriors at the rear .
yes , they were .
the terra-cotta warriors were in the same manner looked when excavated ?
they were vividly molded .
look , their facial expressions vary .
yes . some are proud , some ferocious and some even close to a smile .
it &apos;s amazing that the sculpture had attained such a high artistic level at that time .
it is really a wonder of the world .
who is it ?

i &apos;m a neighbor of yours and i have no phone.my child is ill and i need to call a doctor .

freeze or i &apos;ll shoot !
what &apos;s up , sir ?
is this a mistake ?
i &apos;m just a traveling student and i don &apos;t have much cash on me .
nonsense ! i want money !
here you are .
please don &apos;t hurt me .
hello.may i speak to receptionist ?
this is receptionist .
can i help you ?
the telephone doesn &apos;t ring .
really ?
i heard it ring once or two times just now .
no .
the windows are open , you might hear the neighbor &apos;s phone .
oh , it might be .
can you repair it for me ?
certainly .
it is right what we should do .
did you leave the door open this morning ?
are you crazy ?
of course not .
we &apos;d better go in and see what &apos;s happening .
i think you are really crazy .
there may be burglars in there.let &apos;s get out of here .
where should we go ?
let &apos;s go to the corner grocery and call the cops .
you know why you were mugged ?
you made a big mistake !
what do you mean ?
you weren &apos;t aware of your surroundings on the way home.that made you an easy target for criminals .
yes . i &apos;ve learned my lesson .
from now on i &apos;ll pay attention to my safety on the street .
me , too .
come here.room 412 quickly , please .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i have a bad headache .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that . i &apos;ll send for a doctor .
thank you so much .
everything will be all right , don &apos;t worry , madam .
good morning , happy hobby shop .
may i help you ?
yes . you sell models , don &apos;t you ?
oh , yes .
they &apos;re our most popular items , we carry all of the major brand names and many of the less well-known brands .
well , i &apos;m not as interested in the makers themselves as in the models .
some friends and i are interested in refighting some of the tank battles of 1940 .
we have some very realistic war games already developed for trying different tactics and strategy for all the major battles in world history .
those usually use bits of cardboard for pieces , don &apos;t they ?
yes , sir .
we &apos;d like to have the actual models .
very good , sir .
if you &apos;ll tell me what you want , i &apos;ll have the stock gather it together before you come in .
that &apos;s a good idea . we need tanks . for the french army , we need 14 r35s and 12 fcm36s ; for the british , 19 m4cs ; for the german , 17 pz38s .
o.k. i &apos;ve got that .
anything else ?
yes . we &apos;re short on both mortars and antiaircraft guns for the dutch army and automatic rifles for the belgian army .
fine , i &apos;ll see what we have .
what about aircraft , motorcycles and the like ?
no , i think we &apos;re set with what we have .
all right , we &apos;ll be expecting you .
thank you for calling .
good-bye .
thank you .
good-bye .
this is the kowloon bookstore .
may i help you ?
yes . have you got the american monthly magazine &quot; national geographic &quot; ?
what month , sir ?
this month .
just a moment , please .
yes , we have a few copies left , but they &apos;re going very fast .
would you like to reserve a copy ?
yes please reserve one for me .
may i have your name , sir ?
yes , my name is james henderson .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t hear you very well .
would you mind speaking a little louder ?
henderson , hames henderson .
mr. james henderson ?
that &apos;s right .
when will you come for it , sir ?
i &apos;ll come right down for it .
thank you .
we &apos;ll be waiting for you , sir .
excuse me , do you have the time ?
yes , it &apos;s 10 : 15 .
thank you very much .
what &apos;s the time now ?
9 : 45 .
is your watch right ?
i think so .
it keeps very good time .
what time is it by your watch , mr. wang ?
let me see .
it &apos;s a few minutes after five .
can you tell me the exact time ?
my watch says 5 : 03 , but it &apos;s about two minutes slow .
excuse me , what time is it now ?
it &apos;s seven sharp .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
what &apos;s the weather forecast today ?
the newspaper says , &quot; fine , with occasional showers . &quot;
hadn &apos;t we better put off our picnic for anther day ?
no , let &apos;s take a chance and go .
but it looks like rain just now .
black clouds are gathering !
yesterday morning , the sky was also covered with clouds , but it turned out to be fine .
i think , a shower won &apos;t last long .
it &apos;ll soon clear up .
don &apos;t worry .
well , if you insist , let &apos;s have our picnic today .
that &apos;s great !
let &apos;s get things ready .
i &apos;m afraid you got caught in the this morning .
did you get wet all through ?
no .
the shower came on all of a sudden , but i escaped the worst of it .
it didn &apos;t look like rain at all this morning , did it ?
but you never can tell .
i usually carry an umbrella all the time in this season .
but i forgot all about it this morning .
you must be careful in this weather .
yes , it &apos;s awfully wet .
see , the sky is heavy , it &apos;s going to come down again .
i &apos;m so glad you needn &apos;t go out this afternoon .
so am i.
we &apos;ve been having so much rain these days . it seems to be clearing up , though .
really ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what does the weatherman say about tomorrow ?
warm and sunny.but i don &apos;t believe it .
i &apos;m wondering if it &apos;s going to be fine this afternoon .
so what ?
i &apos;m going to visit my aunt in georgia .
don &apos;t you see the wind &apos;s beginning to lift it up ?
i bet it will be fine tomorrow .
but do you know the weather forecast ?
yes .
it says it &apos;s foggy and sometimes it will be overcast with drizzle today .
but it &apos;ll be clear and fine tomorrow .
that &apos;s good news .
what is the weather like today ?
it has stopped snowing , but there &apos;s a bitter cold wind .
look at the icicles there hanging from the eaves !
and the streets are covered with ice .
do you happen to know what the temperature is today ?
i missed today &apos;s weather forecast over the radio .
it feels like 15 degrees below zero at least .
i don &apos;t mind the cold weather , but i do hate it when it gets slippery .
the ice will soon be thick enough for skating .
i &apos;m so fond of winter sports !
that &apos;s fine .
let &apos;s go skating together tomorrow .
beautiful weather , isn &apos;t it ?
sure is .
it &apos;s quite clear .
i think it will continue to be fine .
i hope so .
you &apos;re from los angeles , aren &apos;t you ?
yes , i am .
is the climate there similar to what we have here ?
not quite !
usually we don &apos;t have so many windy and dusty days.also , the summer is never so hot as this is .
we &apos;ll have a heat wave , i feel .
it &apos;s really very close and sultry today . not a leaf is stirring .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s muggy and oppressive . there &apos;s hardly a breath of air .
i feel a thunderstorm is brewing . do you see the sheet-lightning there ?
yes , i do .
the sky is overcast and the sun is going in . it looks like rain .
what a gust of wind .
it &apos;s beginning to rain .
the rain is torrential . it &apos;s absolutely pouring down now .
it &apos;s raining cats and dogs .
it &apos;s clearing up . the clouds are lifting .
yes , it has left off raining .
look at this wonderful rain-bow !
would you like a package tour or traveling alone ?
i prefer a package tour , so we don &apos;t have to worry about accommodation , meal or that sort of thing .
i prefer traveling alone and having a lot of time to linger in one place .
what are you planning for next weekend ?
i haven &apos;t given it thought yet .
have you got anything special in mind ?
let &apos;s go to valley park on sunday , shall we ?
that &apos;s a good idea .
would you be interested in sightseeing ?
yes .
where do you suggest we go ?
how about broadway ?
that &apos;s wonderful .
would you like to visit wall street with us tomorrow , mary ?
i &apos;d love to .
i &apos;ve heard so much about it .
we &apos;ll visit the stock exchange there .
that &apos;s good .
thanks for inviting me .
i &apos;m going on a guided tour around the mountain city .
are you coming with me ?
thank you , but i have to see my parents tomorrow .
have fun !
thank you .
shall we go alone or as part of a group ?
well , we &apos;re arranged to go on a package tour .
would you like to join us ?
ok .
what interesting places are there to see ?
many , such as central park , the statue of liberty and lincoln center .
i &apos;m sure you will enjoy it .
do you have a map of new york ?
yes , i do .
i can give you this one .
i suggest you stop at the visitor &apos;s bureau near the train station .
they can give you more information .
thank you .
what can i see in my two days here ?
we can take you to most of the places of interest in a couple of days .
that &apos;s great .
i bet you had your picnic on the island .
yes .
it was marvelous .
the water was warm when we swam .
what a day we had !
i wish i had joined you .
well , did the others enjoy it too ?
you bet .
we &apos;ll never forget it .
hi , tom .
when did you get back from shenzhen ?
just yesterday .
how was your trip ?
i loved it .
i visited &quot; splendid china &quot; and &quot; china &apos;s folk culture villages &quot; , and i had a great time .
well , tell me , what &apos;s your impression of shenzhen ?
it &apos;s smaller and much less crowded than guangzhou .
its market tours were not as fascinating as guangzhou &apos;s , i think .
where do you intend to spend your summer vacation this year , jane ?
i &apos;ll spend my vacation in the mountains , as usual .
i &apos;ve been going to the mountains every summer with a group of tourists .
last summer , we found a site where was a crystal-clear stream near by .
why did you choose a site with a stream near by ?
i like swimming , you know .
in the afternoon , i &apos;d like to plunge into the stream to cool off .
where do you like to go for your summer vacation this year ?
i &apos;ll go to the seaside , as i did last year .
as for me , vacation is no vacation without the sea .
why so ?
it seems to me i can never tired of the sea .
it is beautiful in all kinds of weather , and at all times of the day .
did you go bathing in the sea while you were there ?
yes , of course .
we &apos;d go bathing even in the evening , with the silver beams of the moon reflected on the water .
that sounds very interesting !
well , i &apos;ve changed my mind .
i &apos;ll go to the seaside this year for a change .
mr bowen drops mr li and mr yang at their hotel and rushes back to his office .
the chinese , having accomplished the major task of their trip , decide to have some entertainment for relaxation .
xiao yang , i &apos;ve visited la twice and can be your tour guide for this area .
so what do you want to see ?
disneyland is a must .
i &apos;m also dying to see hollywood , the movie city .
yes , there is the universal studios .
i also want to see the ocean park , santa monica beach and .
i &apos;m afraid we have time only for disneyland and the universal studios , as we only have one and half days .
we &apos;ll go to mr bowen &apos; home for a barbecue party on sunday afternoon . do you still remember ?
oh yes .
but can we first see a movie tonight ?
of course we can .
i like action movies .
car chases , gun fights .
i like them too .
but let &apos;s have dinner first .
what do you suggest we eat ?
let &apos;s have a typical american dinner .
there is no such a thing as a &quot; typical american dinner &quot; .
there are only french food , chinese food , italian food , mexican food , or mixtures .
well . then what would be a typical dinner for americans ?
i think it &apos;s perhaps steak , baked potato and green salad .
all right , i &apos;ll try that .
have you ever heard of american greyhound buses ?
yes , i have .
you can go to every corner of the united states by greyhound bus , can &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re right .
last summer i traveled from new york to san francisco by greyhound .
why did you take the bus instead of the train ?
well , i can see the country better that way .
you mean you can see the country better because the bus is slower ?
no , not that .
the bus takes a better route as far as scenery is concerned .
incidentally , the greyhound bus is very first .
in the open country , it often travels at sixty-five miles an hour .
that fast ?
i &apos;ve never taken such a fast bus .
a greyhound this is air-conditioned , too . and it has reclining seats .
i wish i could make a transcontinental trip by grey hound bus .
have you ever been to other countries ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
if i could afford it , i &apos;d certainly take a trip abroad .
that &apos;s also my dream .
how about going to france next summer vacation ?
let &apos;s think about it .
could you give me some information on your australian tours ?
of course.we have several package tours you may choose from .
wonderful ! what &apos;s the cost ?
the price of a 10-day tour for one person is only $ 1 , 088 , which includes round-trip air-tickets .
that sounds reasonable .
let me think it over .
ok , but don &apos;t delay too long .
stevens , do you think travelling is too expensive and it takes up too much time ?
i don &apos;t think so .
travelling enhances my experience and offer me chances to make friends with people from different parts of the world .
can you maintain that relationship ?
sure .
three years ago , when i was in london , i met a girl from singapore . we visited the tower of london and the st. paul &apos;s cathedral together . we enjoyed ourselves very much .
two years later , we got married .
oh , that sounds so romantic .
anna , i haven &apos;t seen you for ages . where have you been ?
i took a trip to the hainan island with some former classmates .
did you enjoy yourselves ?
yes . can you imagine we went swimming almost every day ?
wasn &apos;t it too cold to swim ?
no . even though it was winter , the weather was quite warm . we just wore t-shirts , shorts or skirts or skirts .
terrific .
we really enjoy the beautiful ocean scenery , the tasty seafood , the fresh coconut juice and the friendly people .
where are you going for your christmas vacation ?
i &apos;m thinking of travelling all over china . but i haven &apos;t made up my mind yet .
how long is your christmas vacation ?
two weeks .
i don &apos;t think you will have enough time to travel all around china . i suggest you should choose one or two famous scenic spots .
thank you for telling me of that .
then , i &apos;m going to beijing , xian and suzhou . if time permits , i- also want to visit guilin .
have a good time !
thanks .
i hope so .
have you ever been to hong kong ?
yes , i went there to visit my aunt last month .
what do you think of hong kong ?
it is fascinating .
i &apos;m impressed with its prosperity .
the skyscrapers , the department stores , the lovely parks , and especially the ocean park , are all wonderful .
it &apos;s a good place for sightseeing and shopping , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
but everything is expensive . it is also crowded , even much more crowded than guangzhou i think .
what about the traffic ?
it &apos;s very convenient to take the subways .
that sounds great .
if i have a chance , i will visit hong kong , too .
guangzhou is beautiful and the weather is marvelous .
after we check in at the hotel , why don &apos;t we do some sightseeing ?
i &apos;d enjoy that .
what do you think i should see ?
but i can &apos;t wait to see the pearl river first .
good .
let &apos;s do that and some of the local sights today .
look !
that &apos;s the statue of liberty .
what a spectacular view !
maybe it is the most famous single monument in the usa .
it is . it has become a symbol of new york . and of the usa . for millions of immigrants it was a symbol of the american dream . it was a gift from the french people . its designer also designed the world famous eiffel tower .
he was so great .
what was his name ?
i am sorry , i can &apos;t remember .
the day when lady liberty was unveiled , more than one million people came to watch and celebrate .
that must have been very spectacular .
it was .
it has stood against the harsh sea air for more than 200 years .
in 1986 it was renovated at the cost of 70 million dollars .
by the way , are visitors allowed to climb up the statue ?
yes , an elevator takes visitors to the top pedestal .
that &apos;s the first thing i &apos;d like to do .
i suggest you include ellis island in your trip .
ellis island is a small island only a mile away form lady liberty .
there you could know more about the history of american immigration .
it was looked upon with dread by the immigrants .
why was it ?
most immigrants could not speak english .
they had to wait their turn to be examined by doctors and officials .
they were afraid to be refused admission .
but it was the immigrants who brought prosperity to the land .
without immigrants , the states couldn &apos;t be what it is today .
here we are .
the second largest city in the netherlands , rotterdam .
it &apos;s not what i expected .
where are all the old , quaint houses like in amsterdam ?
rotterdam was almost completely bombed out during the second world war .
it was built back up from scratch after the war .
it does seem new and modern .
it is , but its history , like amsterdam &apos;s goes bake many centuries .
after the war , the city planners decided to give it a modern look with shopping districts and broad avenues .
rotterdam is the world &apos;s largest seaport , you know .
what ?
you mean new york isn &apos;t ?
not any more .
rotterdam handles more trade by ship than any other city in the world .
the dutch have always been expert traders .
that &apos;s true .
it &apos;s a small country , but it &apos;s always been well-developed .
let &apos;s catch a concert tonight in one of rotterdam &apos;s many theaters , ok ?
that &apos;s great .
have you ever been to sydney before ?
no .
this is the first trip .
could you tell me what to see here ?
with pleasure , sir .
the attraction here are too many .
how long will you stay here ?
a week .
you &apos;ll find even a month or two isn &apos;t long enough .
so you can only visit some top attractions such as the sydney opera house , harbor bridge .
the sydney opera house and the harbor bridge .
i &apos;ve seen the opera house many times in pictures and on television .
it &apos;s world famous .
but you should also check out the native aussie wildlife in the taronga zoo and the sydney aquarium and get a dose of down under culture at the australia museum .
taronga zoo , sydney aquarium , and .
and australian museum .
also try to take time out to visit one of the nearby national parks for a taste of the australian bush , and if it &apos;s hot take your swimsuit and towel to bondi beach .
i can &apos;t catch all these names .
can you write down these names for me ?
have you got a map of sydney ?
no .
it &apos;s available at the newspaper stand over there .
let me accompany you there and circle out the top attraction for you .
it &apos;s so kind of you . a map of sydney , please .
here you are .
thank you .
oh , the map is so nice that it offers the information i &apos;d like to know .
yes .
here is suggestion for an itinerary of one week only .
thank you very much.you &apos;ve been most helpful .
everything here is so new to me . and everything seems to be so vivacious .
yes . auckland is a city full of energy .
it is not merely a landing port , but a good place to visit on vacations as well .
it has first-rate attractions .
and the cuisines are diverse and terrific .
do you like the local cuisines such as the maori cuisine ?
very delicious , i think .
it &apos;s incredible that many restaurants serve chinese dishes too . and they taste as good as those back in china .
it is said that there are nearly 1 000 restaurants in auckland ?
incredible !
is wellington larger than auckland ?
no .
auckland is the largest city in new zealand .
but wellington is the capital .
auckland was the capital until 1840 .
therefore , auckland abounds in museums , galleries , and theaters . it &apos;s a very important cultural city .
i hear wellington develops very quickly .
yeah , you &apos;ll see its charms next tuesday .
it has come alive in almost every aspect .
it is a base to many national cultural companies and schools .
does it have any museums or something like that ?
yes .
te papa tongarewa museum , of course , the latest major attraction .
and it has been built with a style , scale , and flair that much of the world is envious of .
once you have seen , or are about to see .
i seem to be in a dilemma .
i want to explore auckland more while i can &apos;t wait to see wellington .
the solution to your dilemma is to strictly follow the plan we &apos;ve made .
that &apos;s ok .
melbourne is really a melting pot .
it is .
there are more people of greek descent living here than in any other city in the world , except athens . then there are the chinese , the italians , the vietnamese , and the lebanese . they &apos;ve all added something to melbourne .
it reminds me of new york .
they are quite similar in this respect .
in fact , almost a third of melbourne were born overseas or have parents who were born overseas .
seeing people of different nationalities live together harmoniously is a real pleasure .
i plan to take some walking tours .
that &apos;s fine .
there are many attractions we &apos;ll have to visit .
what are they ?
melbourne zoo , national gallery of victoria , queen victoria markets and so on .
what &apos;s special about the melbourne zoo ?
this place is a must-see .
this zoo was built in 1862 , and it &apos;s the oldest zoo in the would , and still among the best .
there are some 3 000 species of animals here , including the ever-popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats .
are the animals caged ?
most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens .
that &apos;s really special .
you are right . it &apos;s rewarding to walk in the narrow streets .
the winding streets opened up a completely new world to me when i first come here three years ago .
the tidy rows of houses in vivid blues , greens , and pinks led me into a colorful world .
it makes this trip more colorful too .
thank you so much for your suggestion .
seeing chinese characters in a foreign country makes me feel back at my comfortable hometown .
there ! it is a tea shop .
almost every tea shop here severs chinese tea .
look ahead . that may be a chinese temple .
no .
that &apos;s corner of a hindu temple .
look over the roof line .
steel and glass skyscrapers .
what a view !
it &apos;s quite different from that seen in the wide modern streets .
yeah , a walking tour in singapore is actually a cultural tour .
you can see how closely different cultures merged while keeping their own features .
perhaps that &apos;s the magic of singapore .
the melding of distinct cultures from china , india , southeast asia , and europe has created a unique nation .
you &apos;ll see there cultural influences on every city block , hear them in every historical account , and taste them in very dish you are served .
does the singapore explorer program include the narrow streets ?
you mean the one-day tour by bus ?
the bus does take you across some narrow streets . but before you know it , you may have come into the modern world .
it &apos;s really kind of you to accompany me here .
my pleasure .
what do you think about bangkok ?
i like the city very much , especially its wonderful climate .
it &apos;s like new york in many aspects . its prosperity can rival that of new can its pace .
it seems that you are very familiar with bangkok .
yes , it &apos;s the third time i &apos;ve been here .
its charms are so impressive that i &apos;ve decided to spend five summer vacations on end here .
what about you ?
this is my first trip here . i think i &apos;m fond of the city .
it &apos;s a city of diversity .
here you can enjoy the warm sunshine like that of florida , the idyllic life lie that of guilin , the modern culture that can match that of new york , london , or paris .
some people say cultures are embodied in buildings and collections .
yes .
as you know , the buildings and collection here reflect both western and eastern cultures , ancient and modern cultures .
and cultures are closely related to daily activities , festivals and ceremonies .
have you witnessed some of the cultural events here ?
not yet .
i arrived here this morning .
i recommend you include some of these activities in your trip , and you can peek into the lives of the thai people .
that &apos;s for sure .
thank you .
you can call tourism authority about upcoming traditional festivals and ceremonies .
their number is 282-9773 .
some of my fondest experiences have been the times when i &apos;ve come to these occasion our of curiosity only to find myself an active participant , welcomed and encouraged by friendly thai hosts .
that &apos;s an excellent idea .
i &apos;d like to watch the thai boxing and snake show .
that &apos;s simple .
you can enjoy both in the streets , parks , or stadiums . you &apos;ll find them very wonderful .
i can &apos;t wait to watch them .
yesterday , i enjoyed the sightseeing of los angeles .
do you have any tour to disneyland ?
because my friend told me disneyland would be a &quot; must &quot; while staying in los angeles .
certainly , yes .
how much ?
it depends on the type of tour .
18 dollars for disneyland-afternoon and evening , 14 dollars for disneyland by-night and 18 dollars for all-day disneyland .
is any meal included ?
no , it &apos;s not .
but can we have meals there ?
of course , you can .
cafeteria , for example , and the good restaurant of disneyland hotel are available .
where can i join this tour ?
please be here and a tour guide will pick you up .
i see .
let me think it over .
thank you very much .
could you tell me something about disneyland ?
sure .
is that where you &apos;re going ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ll visit it with my family .
i &apos;ll tell you what i can remember .
thank you !
is these a history museum in your city ?
yes , of course .
when is it open ?
every day from 9 : 00 a.m. to 4 : 00 p.m.
isn &apos;t there a waterfall further on ?
i can almost smell it .
yes , there is .
i remember it &apos;s not far from here .
well , let &apos;s drive down and see it .
ok .
have you ever seen a mountain like this before ?
no .
in fact , this is the highest mountain i &apos;ve ever seen .
let &apos;s enjoy it while we can !
the views form the top of the hill are magnificent .
yes .
we can even see a fine view of the lake here .
how beautiful !
it &apos;s really fascinating .
did you go and see the old fort last time you were in new england ?
yes , it was marvelous .
well , tell me about it , please .
ok .
good morning !
could you tell me some places of historical interest in nanjing ?
have you ever been nan-jing before ?
no , this is my first trip here .
i &apos;m very pleased to suggest that you go to visit the hongmei garden , nanjing zoo , the yangtze river bridge and so on .
oh , great !
we &apos;ll have a good chance to feast my eyes .
kali temple is much more mysterious than i expected-its architecture , trees , atmosphere , and .
and especially the people .
yeah , they seem to by very pious .
they are .
they worship their gods more than most westerners worship god .
look . some goats are over here .
oh , the goats are to be sacrificed to their god .
let &apos;s go and look at the ceremony .
ok . where shall we go after the ceremony ?
there are many attractions to visit here in calcutta .
we &apos;ll visit the india museum in the afternoon .
it is the largest and probably the best museum in india .
you know , once calcutta was the capital of british india .
the museum must be very grandeur , isn &apos;t it ?
grandeur as it is , it is dusty and worse for wear due to lack of funds .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
so many people living in such a small country is not easy .
it is reasonable that they should are for their stomach first .
tomorrow let &apos;s go to the botanical gardens .
you &apos;ll see a 200-year-old banyan tree .
it is claimed to have the second largest canopy in the world .
that &apos;s good idea .
look , the ceremony begins .
do you see the ancient building ?
yes .
these buildings are very impressive .
these are beautiful examples of traditional architecture .
it &apos;s really worth seeing .
have you ever visited a redwood forest ?
i &apos;ve never seen a redwood tree . i really can &apos;t imagine how big they are .
the dictionary says they &apos;re the tallest living things . some are more than three hundred fifty feet high . but none of the trees in muir woods is that tall . you have to go further north in california to see the tallest trees .
you said that muir woods is near san francisco ?
i guess it must be quite an attraction .
yes .
i &apos;ve heard that many redwood trees are thousands of years old .
are the ones in muir woods that old ?
the oldest documented age for a coastal redwood tree is more than two thousand years .
the trees in muir woods are 400 to 800 years old .
why do they survive so long ?
they have remarkable resistance to forest fires .
the coastal redwoods also like a damp , foggy climate .
some people seem to feel that there is nothing much to do in guangzhou for relaxation .
do you find that ?
not really .
i often climb the baiyun mountain at the weekends , and when i have time , i visit a nearby city .
oh , that sounds lovely .
i wonder if you have ever visited zhanjiang.that is my hometown .
no , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever heard of that city .
is it near here ?
yes , it &apos;s just in the west of guangdong province . it &apos;s quite easy to get to .
what kind of place is it ?
well , it &apos;s quite a medium city . it has a very long coastline .
where do you intend to spend your vacation this year , mabel ?
i &apos;ll spend my vacation at the seaside as usual .
why do you choose the seaside ?
i like swimming , you know .
where do you like to go for your summer vacation this year ?
i &apos;ll go to beijing , as i did last year .
why so ?
it seems to me i can never tire of historical sites .
they are attractive in all kinds of weather , and at all times of the day .
that sounds very interesting !
well , i &apos;ve changed my mind .
i &apos;ll go to beijing this year for a change .
next week i &apos;m going to new york for a visit . what do you suggest i see ?
you should see the united nations .
it is located in the middle of the city .
from there you walk over to broadway and a major movie or play .
i &apos;m interested in schools and the courses they offer .
then i suggest you go to columbia university and new york university .
they are two of the best schools in the city and they offer excellent courses .
what about wall street ?
you should visit the stock exchange where all the stock transactions take place .
do you have a map of the city ?
yes , i do .
i can give you this one .
i suggest you stop at the visitor &apos;s bureau near the train station .
they have good maps and they can give more tourist information about the city .
hello.could you arrange a taxi for me in advance ?
certainly .
what time would you like it ?
about 6 : 00 a.m.tomorrow.
where will you go ?
to the airport .
and how much will it be ?
to the airport it should be about $ 80 .
i &apos;ll leave your hotel tomorrow .
can &apos;t you stay a little longer ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t .
i have a meeting to attend .
oh , i see .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying your stay with us .
i had a good time with you .
you were all so kind to me .
it was our pleasure .
we hope to see you again .
i think i must be off now .
please remember my best regards to your family !
thank you very much .
bon voyage !

well , i think we should start earlier .
it may take some time on the way . there are always many traffic jams in this city .

this tea business is something typically british .
oh !
if i had know that , i wouldn &apos;t have asked you to tea .
but it was a good thing you did .

i &apos;ve seen plenty of them since i came to england .
being a historian , of course you would .
i &apos;ve been planning to drive along the road by the thames some day .
shall i take you along ?

it must be fun to tour along the thames in a car instead of a boat .

scene 3 in bob &apos;s car
it &apos;s a nice day , isn &apos;t it ?
we are lucky to have this fine weather for our trip .
yes , such a day is so rare in london .
i &apos;m not used to this maritime climate yet .
it &apos;s too damp for me .
same here .
what &apos;s the climate like in beijing , lily ?
we have continental climate there .
the rain falls mostly in summer when we need it most .
autumn is the best time of the year in that ancient city , when there &apos;s warm sunshine almost every day . oh , my goodness !
i &apos;ll make myself homesick , if i go on talking like this .
don &apos;t go on , then .
ah !
here we are at last .
look !
that &apos;s where the famous london bridge used to be .
you mean the old tower bridge that kept falling down ?
yes .
do you happen to know that english folksong : london bridge is falling down ?
i can &apos;t tell you unless you sing it to me .
ok , here it goes !
that &apos;s not all .
you only sang the first verse ; there should be several more .
please go on , bob !
but it &apos;s the only verse i know .
where did you learn this british folksong , any-way ?
you are surprised that a yankee like me can sing it , aren &apos;t you ?
but you forget i happen to be a student of history , and this folksong is historical .
how did you get to know it ?
i learnt it from joan , an english friend of mine .
it &apos;s you turn to sing now .
i &apos;d very much like to hear the other verses .
please begin from the second verse !
i &apos;m sorry to say : if i could , i would , but i can &apos;t , so i won &apos;t .
wait minute !
i don &apos;t git it .
a second ago you said you knew the song , and now you say if you could sing it , you would , but you can &apos;t , so you won &apos;t-all this rigmarole sounds like a chinese riddle to me .
the reason is very simple : i sing out of tune , you see .
bad luck !
happy journey agency .
can i help you ?
yes .
i &apos;d like to book a one-way ticket to shanghai .

there are two places i really want to see .
one is the fisherman &apos;s wharf and the other is the golden gate park .
the morning tour does include a stop at fisherman &apos;s wharf , but i &apos;m afraid our tours don &apos;t include the park .
you might enjoy going there on your own . you could easily spend a whole day there relaxing .
that might be a good ides .

is there still room ?
yes , there is .
will this be for yourself only ?

act five
tea and dinner
scene 1 in the dining-room
hello , becky !
you are down at last !
i &apos;ve been waiting for you .
see the two cups and saucers ?
they &apos;ve set the table for two .
it &apos;s such a lovely day !
let &apos;s have tea in the garden , shall we ?
it &apos;s not a bad idea .
but isn &apos;t jack coming ?
no .
he has tea at his office on weekdays , and mrs. west has her cup of tea in her own room .
let &apos;s lay the table under that tree .
all right .
but no englishman would do that .
why not ?
sunshine is so precious in england !
yes .
sunny boy , you are sure to be most popular in london .
beautiful home you have here .
thank you .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
act seven
work and rest
scene 1 at the hostel
hello , joan !
oh , it &apos;s lily !
are you surprised to see me ?
well , yes .
i thought you were working hard in your room as usual .
no , not on saturday evenings .
they are evenings for rest .
and all the other evenings are for work ?
oh , what a workaholic you are !
i &apos;ve come to watch the tv news .
it &apos;ll be on in a few minutes .
i &apos;m glad you are interested in current affairs , but every morning you only read the headlines in the papers and that &apos;s about all you care as far as the world is concerned .
as a matter of fact , i was rather fond of watching the telly during my first month in london .
but after watching some of the series for a few weeks .
i found they were all more all more or less the same .
don &apos;t you thin so ?
yes ! the hero is always an almighty detective , or spy , or cow-boy , and there &apos;s got to be one or two most alluring women who fall in love with him and sleep with him .
and there &apos;s endless shooting and fighting , robbery and theft , as well as car chases .
i &apos;m sick and tired with them , too .
let &apos;s to to the cinema some day for a change !
shall we ?
all right .
but let me warn you beforehand : if you go to the pictures , you won &apos;t find them much better than most of the tv series .
we can pick a good film .
what about a film that &apos;s won an oscar reward ?
that &apos;s not a bad idea .
when there &apos;s a really good one on , i &apos;d love to go to see it .
lily , you promised mr. grey the other day not to work terribly hard any longer , but i haven &apos;t found much change in you so far .
you can &apos;t expect anyone to change his or her way of life all of a sudden .
can &apos;t you see i &apos;m trying hard to relax ?
that &apos;s good .
would you like to go window-shop-ping with me tomorrow morning ?
yes , i would very much like to , but let &apos;s not go to the west end or any other posh shopping centers !
shopping in the west end ?
oh , no , not me !
unless there &apos;s a big sale in one of those expensive shops .
i don &apos;t want to go shopping there even when there &apos;s a sale on , unless i suddenly become a millionaires or billionaires .
alice is a little girl , about four years old .
accompanied by her father &apos;s guitar , her &apos; twinkle , twinkle little star &apos; is so cute that everybody gives her a lot of cheers .
now i &apos;d like to present the world &apos;s greatest peking opera singer to you .
here is kang li .
oh , no , no .
i &apos;m not prepared . i can &apos;t sing .
oh come on .
no body expects a professional opera singer at a barbecue party .
we &apos;re here just for fun .
i &apos;ll play a few jazz tunes next .
so come on , mr li .
all right .
now let &apos;s give mr li a big hand .
can i get you a drink ?
thanks .
do you have scotch ?
yes .
can i get you a drink ?
yes , thank you .
well , how about a glass of sherry ?
that sounds fine .
scene 2 at a boarding-house
li li has just arrived in becky &apos;s bed-sitting-room .
help yourself to a cigarette , lily !
the cigarette box is on the little table over there .
no , thank you .
i don &apos;t smoke .
would you like a drink ?
i have scotch whisky , as well as sherry for ladies .
which do you prefer ?
i &apos;m afraid i have to say &quot; no , thank you &quot; again .
i &apos;m practically a teetotaler .
really ?
there &apos;s a chinaman living in this boarding-house .
like you , he doesn &apos;t drink or smoke . i mean he only has beer , but never any alcoholic .
are all chinese student great &quot; saints &quot; like you two , i wonder ?
no , certainly not .
in any of the chinese colleges , you would find a few students who drink like a fish and smoke like a chimney .
but among the workaholics , i don &apos;t think there is any alcohlic at all .
i guess that &apos;s the case with students all over the world .
by the way , the chinese student in this house said he might have met you once in china .
what &apos;s his name ?
i can &apos;t pronounce his surname properly , but i know it &apos;s same as the english word , &quot; sun &quot; - the sun in the sky . it sounds funny when i try to say it .
is it sun ?
there is such a chinese surname , but i can &apos;t think of anyone i know by this name .
never mind .
if you come to a dance in this house on friday night after next , you &apos;ll meet him .
would you like to ?
yes , very much .
i &apos;m looking forward to it .
looking forward to the dance , or to meeting him ?
both .
let me remind you , becky , you &apos;ve promised to go to the theatre with me some day .
have you forgot ?
of course not .
shall we do it something next week ?
just as you like .
let &apos;s do play , a matinee preferably .
what play shall we go to ?
have you got today &apos;s papers ?
there &apos;s no use to go over the newspaper ads .
i have three in mind already .
that &apos;s good !
let me hear what they are .
first or all , shakespeare - what about hamlet ?
it will be on next week at the open-air theatre in one of the london parks .
that sounds interesting .
and there &apos;s the mousetrap . it &apos;s a thriller by agatha christie , which has been on in london for years .
the third one is the death of a salesman .
it &apos;s by the famous american play-wright , miller , isn &apos;t it ?
it was staged in beijing a few years ago ; i saw it and enjoyed it very much .
well , that leaves us only two choices now .
incidentally , i &apos;m planning to go to the stratford-on-aven festival in the summer holidays .
what a coincidence !
i &apos;ve been thinking of doing the same thing .
let &apos;s go together next summer vacation .
that &apos;ll be fine .
well , that strikes out hamlet , leaving us the mousetrap only .
going to the mousetrap ?
oh , no , not me !
i don &apos;t want to be trapped either !
could i get you something to drink ?
yes , please .
would you like scotch , bourbon , chablis or fruit juice ?
chablis is fine .
have some more tea .
no , thank you .
i &apos;ve really got to go now .
enjoy your trip home .
thanks a lot .
oh , it &apos;s five o &apos;clock already . i must be going .
can &apos;t you stay a little longer ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
well , come again whenever you &apos;re free .
i &apos;ll do that . thanks for the tea .
not at all . see you later .
bye-bye .
oh god , it &apos;s late . i &apos;ve got to go .
remember me to your parents .
hope to see them soon .
oh , good luck with your research project . i hope it goes well .
thanks .
well , if you ever pass my home , do drop in .
yes , i will . take care , then .
yes , sure . bye-bye .
bye-bye . all the best .
hello , mr. smith .
i &apos;ve come to say goodbye .

air travel is popular for people who are pressed for time .
but travel by train is not uncommon , especially for people who want to enjoy the landscape .
when traveling by air , make sure that you arrive at the airport early enough to allow check-in time .
the accepted minimum airport check-in time is 45 minutes .
all flights , national or international , operate on local time .
if you are flying for the first time , several things may happen to you during the flight which you should not worry about .
the noise you hear before taking off is from the engines warming up .
if the plane drops suddenly , it is probably an air pocket .
every time a plane hits an air pocket , it always dips a little .
if your ears pop , it is the atmospheric pressure and the problem can be solved by swallowing hard .
you may also notice an increase in engine noise after landing .
this is because the engine reverse-thrust system is used to slow the plane .

in the english speaking countries like the united states and canada , do not ever address a stranger by &quot; comrade &quot; or &quot; master &quot; .
and it is not always appropriate to call a man &quot; sir &quot; and woman &quot; madam &quot; or &quot; miss &quot; , because the situation in which you meet them may not be the same .
the best way to get someones attention is to say &quot; excuse me &quot; and this phrase can be used regardless of sex and age . in this way you will never make a mistake about their titles
in asking directions , try not to have it repeated more than once .
if you can &apos;t follow the speaker you can repeat the key words you think you heard like &quot; three blocks . &quot; in this way , the speaker will realize that he has been speaking too first and will probably slow down for you .

i don &apos;t like them either , but they are fast and convenient .
i hear a new ventilation system has been introduced on some of the newer trains that helps to reduce the noise .
i &apos;ve heard the new subway actually runs on rubber tires and there isn &apos;t so much noise .
in some countries sand is put under the sleepers to cut down the noise .
here comes the train .
let &apos;s get in .
it &apos;ll take only a minute or two .

bus conductors still collect passengers &apos; fares in most towns , but single-deck one-man buses are seen more and more , especially in country districts .
in london , fast buses called ‘ red arrows &apos; run non-stop between important places .

there is no extra charge in the u.k. for travel on express trains except on some trains called &apos; pullmans &apos; .
although all houses should have a street number , many are known only a name .
if you have difficulty in finding such a house , try asking the local shopkeepers or , better still , the postman , if you are lucky enough to see him .
if you know that someone lives in a certain road but you do not know which number , ask at the public library or police station and they will check on the electoral roll .
this is a road-by-road list of all the people entitled to vote .

i &apos;ve been trying to catch your attention now for the last 15 minutes .
no taste at all , it is just like dish water .
oh no. this soup is almost cold .
oh no , this won &apos;t do at all .
the fish is badly cooked .
the sun &apos;s shining straight into my eyes .
is it possible to change tables ?
there &apos;s too much salt in the meat .
this coffee &apos;s too strong .
this mandarin fish tastes as if i t were caught a year ago .
this meat &apos;s as tough as leather .
i told you i wanted it well-done .
we can &apos;t see the band from here . could we change tables ?
well , the chicken &apos;s overdone .
you &apos;ve been ignoring us all evening .
i can offer you some oyster soup , compliments of the chef .
i &apos;ll get you another one .
i &apos;ll have them made you another one .
i &apos;ll let you know when one is free .

perhaps you could tell me what exactly is the matter .
i &apos;m sure the waiters didn &apos;t mean to be rude .
well , there is something else . this wine here , i think it is corked .
but this one here is at most medium .
i &apos;ve had enough .
you asked to see me , mr.smith ?
you see , she just started out as a waitress a week ago and doesn &apos;t understand english very well .
she should have changed your steak .
that &apos;s more like it .
perhaps it is a little too sour for your taste .
this is not what i asked for , i &apos;m afraid .
may i ask what you ordered again ?
i &apos;ve ordered a steak , not a fried chicken .
waitress , i ordered my meal at least twenty minutes ago , and it hasn &apos;t come yet .

i think 250 grams is more than enough for one person .
chinese cookery places great emphasis on three elements : color , aroma and flavor .
the color of a dish has to be satisfying to the eye , and the balance of colors is kept in mind during its preparation .
the chinese cuisine is based on five tastes - sour , hot , bitter , sweet and salty .
by the way , what &apos;s this seasoning made from ?
it &apos;s a mixture of pepper and various spices .
generally , guangdong food is a bit light , sichuan food has a strong and hot taste , shanghai food is rather oily and beijing food is salty and spicy .
what &apos;s the soup of the day ?
we serve some typical guangdong food today : the roast suckling pig , the battle between the dragon and the tiger , fried milk , salt-baked chicken , dog meat casserole .
the mongolian hotpot uses thinly sliced lamb and is done in boiling water contained in a copper hotpot which uses charcoal as firewood .
we have maotai .
it &apos;s real chinese speciality . it &apos;s rather strong but won &apos;t go to the head .
this dish sounds rather fascinating .
how do you prepare it ?
what is the barbecued duck like ?
i &apos;d like some good dishes typically beijing .
this dish is cooked slowly in red win with bacon rolls , button mushrooms , onions and chestnuts .
according to chinese custom , we serve the food first and then the soup , but we &apos;ll bring you the soup first if you like .
the black tea is complimentary , sir .
what can i do for you ?
would you like something to drink ?
i want to look through the drink list first .

when you arrive at a restaurant , you may have to wait a short time before a table is free .
the hostess will ask if you prefer to sit in an area where smoking is allowed or not .
more and more public places in the united states forbid smoking .
after the main meal , people often order dessert such as cake , pie , or ice cream .
if you do , you pay extra .
the waitress will bring you the bill when you finish but , if you can &apos;t wait you can signal the waitress by raising your hand slightly .
if this technique fails , call softly &quot; miss &quot; or &quot; sir &quot; .
but do not shout .
if you have been invited to a restaurant , you don &apos;t have to worry about the cost . otherwise , you pay for your own meal .
this is an accepted practice and not considered at all impolite .
as an expression of your opinion of the waitress &apos;s service , you leave a tip of 10-15 % of the total cost .
in fast food restaurants , however , no tip is necessary .
when you pay for your food , the clerk gives you a number and pay for your food , the clerk gives you a number and you wait at a table till your number is called . then you go to the counter to get it .
when going to a restaurant , try to find and empty table .
if no table if free at the moment , wait in the waiting area .
it is not polite to stand next to people who are eating as many of us do in china .

what kind of tea would you like ?
green tea .
it &apos;s mild , and good for your health .
tea
tea is the most universally used beverage . it is prepared from the dried shoots of an evergreen shrub , thea sinensis , a camellia .
the main tea-producing areas are india , china , including taiwan , sri lanka and japan .
kinds of tea
high quality tea comes from the bud and the first two leaves of the growing shoot , although more mature leaves are used in some teas .
the quality of tea beverage is influenced by the climate where the tea plant is grown .
teas also differ because of the way the leaves are treated before they are dried .
for green tea , the fresh leaves are heated or steamed to inactivate enzymes before they are rolled and dried .
for black tea , the leaves are allowed to wither before they are rolled and dried . then they are held a few hours before they are heated and dried .
during this holding period enzymes in the green leaf catalyze the oxidation of constituents which results in changes in color , taste , and aroma .
such tea is described as fermented , although the changes are due mainly to oxidation .
oolong tea is only partly fermented and a brew from oolong tea has some of the characteristics of both green and black tea .
quality of the beverage
tea beverage of high-quality is clear and bright .
a flavorful cup of tea has a quality known as &quot; briskness , &quot; and a distinct but subtle aroma .
some astringency is inherent in tea , but green tea is more astringent than black .
the strength of the beverage determines whether the taste of the tea is mild of robust .
green tea is pale , greenish yellow , and the black tea is a deep amber color .
constituents in tea
caffeine
tea beverage , as with coffee , is valued for the stimulating effect of the caffeine which it contains .
tea leaves contain more caffeine than does roasted coffee . but the concentration in the beverage averages somewhat less in tea .
values found in the literature include 70 mg , per cup of beverage and 28 mg , 44 mg , and 47 mg per cup for black tea in bags steeped 1,3 , and 5 minutes , respectively .
comparable values given for loose black tea were 31 mg , 38 mg , and 40 mg per cup of beverage .
green and oolong tea beverages , bagged or loose , contained less caffeine than black tea .
tea contains , in addition to caffeine , small amounts of two other methyl xanthines , theobromine and theophylline , 3,7 -dimethy1 and 1,3-dimethy1 xanthine , respectively .
phenolic constituents in green tea
tea leaves are extraordinarily rich sources of a group of compounds known as polyphenolic substances , which account for almost one-third of the weight of dried leaf .
the color of the beverage and much of its taste , especially astringency , is attributed to these polyphenolic compounds , or to their oxidation products in black tea .
green tea contains a number of flavonols with the basic structure specific flavonols found in tea include myricetin , quercetin , and kaempferol , and their glycosides .
other phenolic compounds found in tea even greater concentration than the flavonols are the flavanols .
this group constitutes 80 percent of the total polyphenols in tea . these include catechin and gallocatechin , their esters with gallic acid , catechin gallate , and gallocatechin gallate , and their epimers .
the formulas for these phenolic compounds are epigallocatechin gallate is the main flavanol in dried green tea .
the catechins are responsible for the slightly astringent , metallic taste of green tea beverage . they are involved also in browning and other types of discoloration in foods of plant origin .
another phenolic constituent is tea , theogallin , accounts for approximately 1 percent of the dry weight of the leaf . chlorogenic acid , also a phenolic compound , is a minor constituent in tea .
phenolic constituents in black tea
more than three-fourths of the polyphenolic constituents of tea may be extracted after the leaves are fermented .
in addition to those compounds found in green tea , new ones appear in black tea .
rolling the leaves prior to fermentation permits the polyphenolase enzyme to come in contact with the phenolic substrates and catalyze their oxidation . theaflavins which are formed when flavanols are catalyze their oxidation .
theaflavins which are formed when flavanols are oxidized make up approximately 2 percent of the weight of dried black tea . alone , they are very astringent , and the amount of caffeine in tea should make it very bitter .
it appears that theaflavins modify the bitterness of caffeine and caffeine the astringency of theaflavins , giving the beverage its characteristic briskness .
a second group of substances which appear in fermented tea are the thearubigins , the structures of which are still questioned .
these constitute from 7 to 20 percent of the weight of dried black tea .
the bright orange theaflavins give sparkle to tea and the rusty brown thearubigins depth to the color .
as fermentation proceeds the thearubigins increase and the theaflavins decrease .
the concentration of phenolic substances is greatest in the bud and the first leaf of the harvested tea shoot , is progressively less in leaves 1 to 3 and is least in the stem .
a high phenolic content gives a tea with a high color .
tea leaves are separated into classes according to size and so marketed .
the terms &quot; orange pekoe , &quot; &quot; pekoe , &quot; and &quot; souchong &quot; denote progressively larger leaves of black tea .
the prefix &quot; broken &quot; inserted before each term indicates that the leaves are not intact . smaller pieces of tea leaves are known as &quot; fannings &quot; and fragments which are finer still are designated &quot; dust . &quot; these are used in tea bags .
aroma
the aroma of tea contributes to its appeal .
the volatile compounds responsible have been referred to as essential oils .
approximately 30 compounds have been identified in the aroma of green tea , the major ones being benzyl alcohol , phenylethyl alcohol , a hexenol , linalool , geraniol and methyl salicylate .
the aroma of black tea is more complex . more than 300 compounds are present , half of which have been identified and none of which alone gives a unique black tea aroma .
the breakdown of amino acids which occurs as the flavanols are oxidized gives rise to aldehydes in black tea aroma .
theanine , the ethyl amide of glutamic acid , is the main amino acid in the fresh leaf and contributes 1 to 2 percent of the dried weight , but other amino acids arise during the early part of the processing .
trans-2-hexenal formed from linolenic acid is major component of the aroma .
other constituents are thought to come from the oxidation of acrotenoids of the leaf .
preparing tea beverage
desired soluble constituents , some of which are volatile , are extracted from tea leaves by steeping the leaves in hot water .
the temperature of the water when it is in contact with the leaves is as important in making tea as it is in making coffee .
water which has just come to a rolling boil , not boiled water which makes flat-tasting tea , should be added at once to tea leaves in a preheated pot .
unless the pot is very hot , the temperature of the water will drop too low during steeping for the best extraction .
a lid on the pot as the tea steeps helps prevent loss of heat and escape of steam and aroma from the beverage .
a steeping period of 5 minutes with water at 88 ℃ is required to give tea of the same strength as that steeped 3 minutes at a temperature of 93 ℃ .
minimum temperature of the water when it is in contact with tea leaves is simmering , and at this temperature the time required to steep tea is 6 to 7 minutes .
extracting caffeine from the tea leaves is not a problem because a high percentage of it is removed in 2 minutes by water at 85 ℃ .
thearubigins are more readily extracted than theaflavins .
if water boils when it is in contact with tea leaves , a high proportion of polyphenolic compounds are extracted . these make the hot beverage excessively astringent .
the tea pot should be made of a material other than metal . this is even more important for tea than for coffee because of the high proportion of poly phenolic substances in tea .
coffee bars are popular meeting places for young people .
it is possible to dance in some bars , but alcoholic drinks are not sold .
although the correct name for the midday meal is lunch , many english families call it ‘ dinner &apos; .
to complicate matters further , the mid-morning break of coffee and biscuits is also called ‘ lunch &apos; .
english people do not wish each other ‘ good appetite &apos; .
the english drink more tea than any other nation-7.77 pounds per year or 4.67 cups daily per head .
in times of disaster or tragedy ‘ a nice cup of tea &apos; is offered as a kind of universal cure .
the hours during which english pubs are allowed to open are strictly controlled by the law .
times vary in different parts of the country , but are approximately from 11a.m. to 2.30 p.m. and from 6 p.m to 10.30 p.m or 11 p.m on weekdays , and from 12 noon to 2 p.m and from 7.00 to 10.30 p.m on sundays .
beer , wine and spirits , as well as non-alcoholic drinks like lemonade can be bought at a pub , but it is rare to find one that sells coffee and tea .
at one time , the only food available was sandwiches and meat pies , but nowadays the situation is much better with salads and hot meats served at the bars of many pubs .
look outside for the signs ‘ inn food &apos; and ‘ pub food &apos; .
it is normal to buy one &apos;s own drinks at the bar , and the barman is not tipped unless he brings drinks to the table .
each order is paid for separately , and not at the end of the evening .
inexpensive restaurants known as ‘ fish and chip shops &apos; are something of a national institution in the u.k.
remaining open until about 11 p.m. they are ideal for the motorist on a long journey .
fish and chips can be eaten in the restaurant or taken away wrapped in paper .
foreign visitors to the u.k. are often surprised to see the large number of chinese restaurants — at least one in every town .
these restaurants offer good food at reasonable prices and are very popular .
if america is a pantry , the american kitchen is a laboratory .
it is equipped with a wealth of culinary machines and gadgets designed to simplify the task of preparing foods .
america &apos;s obsession with laborsaving tools and mechanical devices was translated , first into apple ; peelers and ice-cream freezers , and later into space-age ovens , high speed blenders , electric juicers and an extensive catalogue of other implements that have greatly transformed the process of cooking .
the best-known and most popular american foods are grilled steaks , hamburgers , fried chicken , boiled lobster and fried fish .
all of these dishes can be delicious , and none requires much cooking skills .
generally , american cooking is unsophisticated and straightforward , concerned with content rather than form .
it is as varied , inventive and ultimately indefinable as america itself .

as the twentieth century draws toward an end , coca-cola , a little more than a century old itself , stands out as the most successful product in the history of commerce .
people on every continent , in almost every country of the world , are familiar with the name and taste of this world-famous soft drink .
coca-cola was born in atlanta on mary 8 , 1886 , when a pharmacist named dr. john styth pemberton produced the syrup , according to legend in a brass pot in his backyard . when , by accident or design , carbonated water was added to the syrup , it produced a drink that was declared &quot; delicious and refreshing . &quot;
the was registered in the u.s. patent office on january 31 , 1893 .
through clever advertising the demand for the product grew by leaps and bounds .
one great leap forward came in 1894 , when joseph biedenharn of vicksburg , mississippi , impressed with the demand for the drink at his soda fountain , installed bottling machinery and began to sell cases of coca-cola to plantations and lumber camps up and down the mississippi river .
today , the coca-cola bottling system is the largest , most widespread production and distribution network in the world .
in 1916 the uniquely shaped bottle , designed by a glass company in terre huate , indianan , was developed to protect coca-cola from imitations .
in the 1920s coca-cola pioneered in producing &quot; six-packs , &quot; cardboard cartons that held six bottles of the drink .
in 1929 a distinctively shaped fountain glass became standard and helped to advertise the popularity of the drink .
the international growth of coca-cola began in 1900 , when a son of the company &apos;s founder took a jug of syrup with him on a vacation to england .
the same year coca-cola traveled to cuba and puerto rico , where bottling operations soon began , as they did in panama , the philippines , and guam .
the first bottling company on the european continent began operation in france in 1920 .
coca-cola and the olympics began their association in the summer of 1928 , when an american freighter arrived in amsterdam carrying the united states olympic team and 1,000 cases of coca-cola . forty thousand spectators filled the stadium to witness two firsts : the first lighting of the olympic flame and the first sale of coke at an olympiad .
many people outside the united states had their first taste of coca-cola during world war ii .
when 64 bottling plants were shipped abroad to provide more than 5 billion bottles of coke for american service personnel in europe and the pacific .
in the next 20 years the number of countries with bottling operations nearly doubled .
the worldwide appeal of coca-cola was dramatically displayed in 1971 , when young people from around the world gathered on a hilltop in italy to sing &quot; i &apos;d like to buy the world a coke &quot; --- presenting a unifying global spirit .
in 1976 the well-known advertising slogan &quot; the pause that refreshes &quot; was joined by a new slogan : &quot; coke adds life . &quot;
a few years later &quot; have a coke and a smile &quot; was added , and in 1982 the theme &quot; coke is it ! &quot; was launched around the world , followed by &quot; can &apos;t beat the feeling &quot; in the late 80 &apos;s , and &quot; can &apos;t beat the real thing &quot; in the early 90 &apos;s .
&quot; the pause that refreshes &quot; has come a long way in 109 years .
food and wine are among the great attractions of a trip to italy .
the traveler who seeks out interesting eating places will find italy a dream come true .
italian style of cooking is hearty and varied .
you &apos;ll discover that generous use of olive oil , garlic and tomato is confined largely in the south ; in rome and to the north , it is not so frequent ; in the far north , cooking in butter is preferred .
whether you sit down in one of those vast luxury hotels or in a cheaper restaurant , the food is likely to be good , although the prices will vary greatly .
breakfast is the usual continental version . it consists of coffee with hot milk-or tea or hot chocolate if you prefer - bread and rolls , and jam or marmalade .
the main meals , lunch and dinner , both consist of several courses .
lunch is around usually at one o &apos;clock , and dinner around 7 : 30 p.m. it may be later in rome .
lunch and dinner menus usually both consist of the following courses : antipasta includes olives , mushrooms , eggs , tomatoes , etc . - you should also try cured ham with iced melon or fresh figs .
entree can be soup , often of vegetables and herbs . this may be rice cooked with mushrooms , or liver , etc . or it may be one of the assorted flour-based foods , diversely-shaped pieces of paste filled with a meat or vegetable mixture , or the famous pizza . these are followed by fish from the mediterranean or the lakes , or meat dishes --- those being ready to serve are listed under &quot; today &apos;s special &quot; --- and are accompanied by a variety of vegetables .
these usually are ordered separately - potatoes , green vegetables , and salad .
cheese is an important part of an italian meal , and most restaurants offer a wide variety of them - some produced in small family establishments in the meadowlands of alps , others known and exported all over the world .
then comes fruit in season , and finally the dessert , which can be sweeter than anything you ever tasted .
of course , we can not forget its famous table wines , dessert wines , and beer . and there is also a wide selection of mineral waters .
finally , you can hardly think of italy without thinking of ice-cream . today , the best producers of ice-cream are the sicilians and neapolitans .
in short , eating in italy can be a real experience - or it can be a matter of deadly monotony . their difference lies in whether you are willing to try something new , and know the specialties of the various regions . make it an adventure , by seeking out unusual restaurants - interesting because of historical significance , because of their setting , or because of some other characteristics that make them unusual .
hours spent beneath a vine-draped pergola or on a sunlit terrace , before unforgettable scenery of land and sea may well be the most pleasantest memories of your trip to italy .
as america is home to so many different nationalities , one can find almost any kind of restaurant in all the large cities .
the restaurants can range widely in cost from inexpensive to very expensive .
but fast food shops have become very widespread in the u.s. because they are quick and cheap .
and cafeterias are especially popular with american students .
there you can get a variety of food such as fried fish , barbecued chicken , spaghetti , salad , vegetables , macaroni , sweet potatoes , rice , hot rolls .
there are also desserts and drinks .
you can pick up whatever strikes your fancy .
tips are generally not required at cafeterias where you serve yourself and you are expected to clear your own table of dishes and utensils , and discard your trash in the garbage cans .
in most cafeterias , you stand in line . as you walk along , you select items available at a counter .
at normal mealtimes , cafeterias are crowded with people . you can usually get a seat without waiting too long if you eat a little early or a little late .
students entering the cafeterias on the campus are required to present their own valid meal cards . student i.d.cards and any other identification must be presented if requested by dining hall staff , student manages , or checkers .
an individual who refuses to show a student i.d. card will be considered a non-student and a trespasser and will be denied entrance and be told to leave the premises .
dining at students &apos; cafeteria , students are required to follow some rules .
for example , once diners leave the dining hall , they will not be allowed to re-enter during that meal . no food , glass or other dining services &apos; property may be removed from the dining hall . it is expected that students will be courteous to fellow students and dining hall personnel while in it . you are not allowed to break the line . any action that jeopardizes the safety of other students is prohibited . no student if barefooted will be permitted to enter the dining hall . moreover , alcoholic beverages and drugs are not permitted there.people under the influence of alcohol or drug will be required to leave .
another thing that makes a students &apos; cafeteria different from one out of the campus is the way of payment . dining charges are payable in the same manner as tuition and other fees .
the peoples of the scandinavian countries share many affinities because of geographical reasons.but there are more of differences than similarities between them in all aspects , including their drinking cultures .
a superficial observer might think that no one in norway drinks liquor or wine .
meals eaten in restaurants or at home are usually washed down with tea , coffee or milk . occasionally however , pale or dark ale is drunk .
it can be ordered only in restaurants , where it is served only with food .
excellent quality beers are made in jutland and consumption is high .
after beer , brandy is the favorite drink .
aalborg schnapps , made from corn and potatoes , is famous for its high alcoholic content .
for the danes , brandy is also an aperitif and is frequently drunk before meals .
for a foreigner , the practice of surrounding toasts here can be embarrassing .
if he accepts one toast then he is obliged to accept all others , and it is difficult to drink six or seven glasses of brandy unless one is used to it .
ladies are fortunately excluded from these rounds and they drink only a grape-juice with almost no alcoholic content .
it is milk instead of liquor that is the principal finnish table drink .
more milk is drunk by the finnish people than in any other nation .
it is made of curdled milk and a kind of yoghurt - like substance which is a dish on its own ; the latter is especially popular in summer .
a number of home-brewed beers include one made from juniper berries . two well-known finnish liquors are made from cloudberry and arctic bramble .
in finland the sale of alcohol is a state monopoly and a check is kept on consumption by recording purchases on special card issued to all customers .
as there is a distinction between swedish cooking in the south and that in the north because of the difference in soil and climate , their drinking habits are also different .
in the north alcoholic beverages are considered a necessity because they keep out the cold and , as the swedish humorist , alber engstrom said , &quot; because gaiety without alcohol is forced . &quot;
the swedes drink brown ale , lager , brand , and potato spirit .
while in the south people have milder drinks .
but generally speaking , excessive drinking is rare in sweden , partly because the legal penalties against drunkenness are severe , partly because alcohol is rationed .
sale of spirits is controlled , commerce in alcohol being a state monopoly.the swedes drink much coffee and tea .
although all the large towns have coffee bars with modern espresso machines , many people still prefer the old-fashioned coffee served in large cups and accompanied by buns and cakes .
tea is so popular in sweden that it has been called the swedish national drink .
it is still a question when chinese chess was created .
chess was very popular in the imperial court and among scholastic circles at that time .
chinese chess is called &quot; xiangqi &quot; in chinese .
chess must be one of the oldest games in the world .
chess was probably invented in india .
the name &quot; chess &quot; is interesting .
when one player is attacking the other &apos;s king , he says , in english , &quot; check &quot; .
when the king has been caught and cannot more anywhere , he says &quot; check mate &quot; .
check !
check mate !
weiqi is a chinese game for tow .
weiqi is played with black and white stone pieces on a board that is ruled with 19 vertical and 19 vertical and 19 horizontal lines .
weiqi is popular in japan now .
weiqi is the oldest game in the world .
in the spring and autumn period , weiqi was already popular .
in the eastern han dynasty , weiqi players were divided into higher , middle and lower grades .
playing weiqi is just like directing military operations .
weiqi was introduced to japan in the sui and tang dynasties and to europe in the 19 th century .
there are two players in a chess game .
each player is provided with 16 pieces .
there re two kinds of pieces : white ones and black ones .
various pieces are set down in a designed order in the two ranks close to the player .
each piece is moved according to the specific rules .
the object in a chess game is to checkmate the opponent &apos;s king , a piece whose mobility is limited .
look , zhan xugang is doing a clean and jerk .
the sydney olympics adopted a new system of categorizing the weightlifters .
in weightlifting , warming-up is helpful to promote flexibility and prevent muscle injury .
the 63-kilogram weight class competition tonight really got me worked up .
to beat viktor mitrou , he has to lift 202 kilograms in the clean and jerk for he snatched two kilograms less than victor just now .
both the snatch and the clean and jerk are his forte .
with the big muscle masses , he looks very strong and athletics .
she succeeded in lifting 130 kilograms for the last attempt , which helped her won the gold medal .
the three of them have lifted the same weight , that is , 390 kilograms .
the one who weighs least will be the winner of the gold medal .
what are the responsibilities of a referee ?
a referee is responsible for signaling &quot; good lift &quot; or &quot; no lift &quot; .
how is a &quot; good lift &quot; decided ?
two of the three referees must approve the lift by signaling with a white light .
what is the signal for a &quot; no lift &quot; ?
a red light is the signal for a &quot; no lift &quot; .
how many hours a day should a top class weightlifter spend lifting weights ?
a top class lifter should spend at least two hours a day lifting weights and practicing techniques with his coach .
are lifters divided into body-weight categories ?
bodyweight divisions range from the flyweight category under 52 kilos to the super-heavyweight category over 110 kilos .
how many attempts is a lifter allowed to achieve a &quot; good lift &quot; ?
a lifter is allowed three attempts to achieve a &quot; good lift &quot; .
how is the winner of each weight division decided ?
the winner is the lifter who has successfully lifted the heaviest weight at the fewest attempts .
in some competitions , the winner is the lifter who has successfully lifted the highest combined total of weights in the snatch and the clean and jerk .
what are the individual qualities that a weightlifter requires ?
a weightlifter requires strength , stamina , flexibility , balance , coordination and determination .
some people maintain that warming-up promotes flexibility .
do these stretching exercises for 30 seconds .
repeat it eight times .
one , two , three .
relax your muscles , especially , do not be tense in the neck and limbs .
the cool-down will aid recovery .
weightlifting is one of &quot; heavy athletics &quot; .
this weight-lifter set a world record for the total lift at the previous olympic in the lightclass .
what are his total results ?
look at that picture . a weightlifter doing a clean and jerk .
is weightlifting an ancient sport ?
weightlifting became an olympic sport in 1896 .
the individual events for men include floor exercise , vault , pommel horse , horizontal bar , parallel bars , and rings .
at present , balance beam and rhythmic gymnastic are restricted to women only .
she excels in vault , balance beam and uneven bars .
i was strongly impressed with her graceful movements .
his skills in aerial tumbling , balance , flexibility , and originality are really marvelous .
the iron cross and the handstand both require great strength .
men vault over the length of the horse , while women vault over the width of the horse .
in the women &apos;s vault , the athletes are allowed two attempts , with the scores averaged .
his dismount was perfect with the feet together in a standing position .
run-up is very important for the performance of this event .
we all admire her for her free-flowing movement .
his landing is both swift and sure .
she balances herself on the balance beam with a single arm .
he has done a good job , though he failed to capture the all-around championship .
at the sydney olympics , artistic gymnasts were not required to perform compulsory routines .
in rhythmic gymnastics , competitors use apparatus such as the rope , hoop , ball , ribbon and clubs .

what are the different positions in volleyball ?
the three players near the net are called the front line players . the three players at the back of the court are the back line players .
fivb is the world governing body of volleyball .
fivb stands for federation international de volleyball .
the exciting aspect of volleyball is that it attracts all types of players-recreational to competitive , little skilled to highly skilled-and all ages .
the game has great appeal because it requires few basic skills , few rules and limited equipment , and it can be played on a variety of surfaces , from a hardwood floor to a sandy beach .
a typical three-hit combination begins with a forearm pass of the ball to a setter , followed by a set to an attacker , who spikes the ball or tip it into the opponent &apos;s court .
the three players in the front row are called left forward , center forward and right forward .
the three players in the back row are called left back , center back and right back .
players have to be in their correct rotational positions until the serve is executed .
the serve over , players are allowed to play in any position of their choice , with one restriction : back row players cannot leave the floor to hit the ball when in front of the attack line .
ironically , although the game was invented in the united states , americans have watched other countries such as japan , china , brazil , the former soviet union and cuba play leadership role for its development .
the popularity of the game was enhanced greatly when the japanese added it to the olympic games program in 1964 .
under the old scoring system in volleyball , the length of a match could vary from 1 hour to 4 hours .
the variance in time caused great reluctance on the part of the media , especially tv , to cover the event .
recent changes have made the game more attractive for media coverage .
a smart setter can constantly keep the opponents guessing by varying the attack tactics .
as with the dig , a good deal of successful blocking is based on the player &apos;s ability to read the opponent &apos;s attack .
single blocking in volleyball is often not enough .
teams often join two or three players together , forming double or triple blocks , referred to as multiple blocks .
international-caliber volleyball players are tall , with quick reflexes and powerful arms .
in 1984 , world ranking placed china in the number one spot and the u.s. number two .
but for the us to capture the gold and displace china from its throne , the americans must be mighty sharp .
china was an awesome squad .
chinese sensation lang ping led their offensive force with her brilliant spiking power .
in the early 80s , china demonstrated that not only did they play with the quickness of the asian school , but they also had the power to terminate with unstoppable kills , most of which came from the best player of all times , lang ping .
u.s. coach , arie selinger , pointed out that top line american players were injured , including rita crockett , a 5 ′ 8 ″ hitter / blocker who only weeks earlier had undergone knee surgery ; debbie green , the team &apos;s best setter who was recovering from a dislocated ankle ; and julie vollersten , who has also undergone knee surgery .
the american team were no match for the gold medalists china , at whose hands they suffered a straight sets defeat .
the usa had to settle for silver ahead of the japanese team .
the men &apos;s tournament was won by the usa after they managed a 3-0 victory over silver medalists brazil .
the italians finished in bronze medal position .
jennifer had 10 kills ad eight blocks for her team .
beach volleyball made its debut in atlanta in 1996 , but its popularity as a competitive sport began in the 1950s .
the united states and brazil have dominated the scene all along .
beach volleyball does not allow substitutes .
two players play on each side .
the brazilians proved unbeatable , except by one another . they walked off with gold and silver .
yugoslav &apos;s male volleyball team gained revenge for their defeat by russia in the first match of the games by cruising to the gold medal in straight sets .
they crushed the russians 25-22 , 25-22 , 25-20 to reverse the four-set loss inflicted upon them a week ago .
unlike russia or the other top-level teams , yugoslavia didn &apos;t have a standout hitter to rely on for easy points .
yugoslavia got to the championship by being mentally stronger than world champion italy , finding a way and the will to win the close points .
they did the same against russia .
the russians , behind sensational hitter roman yakovlev , led 21-20 in the first game and were tied at 22 in the second , but yugoslavia pulled away both times .
after it was over , grbic stripped to his underwear and wrapped the yugoslav flag around his waist .
after winning medals in its first six olympics , including gold in 1964 , 1966 and 1980 , the russians slumped to seventh in barcelona and fourth in atlanta .
the underdog team of the tournament , peru , squeaked its way to the final with not one , but three 5 set comeback victories in all matches but one .
meanwhile the ussr , which had lost 17-19 in the fifth to japan in pool play , went on to leave the world aghast by blanking then top world power china in the semifinal .
gold again for cuba in an amazing tournament that featured exciting matches and an underdog team that nearly stole the show : the usa .
from being a team of rookies just some years ago , coach mick haley assembled a team with last minute changes .
the russians and the japanese were the two world powers in volleyball up until the 1980s .
the former was a typical example of power volleyball , where sheer physical size was the dominant factor ; the latter used the opposite-quicker plays in order to outpace their physically bigger european opponents .
the history of hockey can date back to thousands ago .
hockey originated from england .
in hockey , two teams of 11 players compete against each other .
they are trying to score by getting the ball into the opponents &apos; goal .
no. 5 of america has excellent stick handling skills .
hockey players are not allowed to use their feet to control the ball .
a penalty stroke may be awarded for offence in the shooting circle .
his stick work and shooting skill are above the average .
a match , which is tied at the end of regulation time , then goes into extra time , and if necessary , to a penalty stroke competition .

we &apos;ve only got enough people for a half-court bullfight .
why is a half-court bullfight so popular ?
basketball was deliberately created in 1891 by a physical education teacher in massachusetts , canadian born james nesmith , to provide an indoor sports activity during the snowy winter months when outdoor out door playing fields could not be used .
dr. naismith &apos;s original 13 rules were the foundation of what is now the most-watched indoor sport in the world .
in recent times , a new rule requires a team to try to score within a brief time : 35 seconds in the collegiate game , 30 seconds in international play , and 24 seconds in american professional play .
team usa &apos;s semifinal game against the hometown chinese team that featured two nba-caliber seven footers in wang zhizhi and yao ming proved to be heartbreaking .
the dallas mavericks made wang zhizhi its second-round pick of the 1999 draft and secured his release from the chinese army &apos;s bayi rockets , paving the way for him to become the first asian player in nba history .
a 46-game winning streak for the u.s. men &apos;s basketball team at the university games ended when yao ming of china blocked melvin ely &apos;s put-back to preserve an 83-82 victory in beijing .
the shanghai team took advantage of a slew of jiangxi turnovers .
yao had foul trouble throughout and eventually fouled out only 1 : 10 into the second half .
he has the ability to sidestep opponents and to make prodigious leaps , blocking shots and grabbing rebounds .
china finished fourth in the pool , guaranteeing its best olympic finish ever and a stark improvement over a 12th and last-place finish at barcelona .
in 1979 two college players , larry bird of indiana state university and magic johnson of michigan state university motivated an increased interest in the game through their friendly rivalry .
jordan seems to have gotten himself into superb shape , having shed at least 30 pounds to get near his last playing weight of 212 , and he is as strong as ever .
the wizards will probably play well one night , horribly the next , frequently earning their leader , michael jordan &apos;s anger , then his wrath , then maybe his rage .
of all the records and distinctions that wilt chamberlain has , one stands out , because it is so unexpected . he played in 1,205 games , regular season and playoffs , and never fouled out-unbelievable given what a physical presence he was .
the heavily favored los angeles sparks got a jump on their bid for their first wnba title , getting 24 points and eight rebounds from lisa leslie in a 75-66 victory over the charlotte sting in game 1 of league finals thursday night .
leslie showed why she was the mvp of both the regular season and the all-star game with a dominating second-half performance to rally the sparks from an 11 point deficit .
most fans sip a cold drink , or possibly dip into a large bag of popcorn , while watching the women &apos;s teams race back and forth on the court .
in march sixty four winning university teams from the conferences around the united states are matched against each other in a single game elimination series called march madness .
one team was stealing the ball and running the length of the court for a layup , while the other was turning the ball over .
some types of misbehavior or unsportsmanlike actions either by the players or their coaches may bring down a technical foul , whereupon the team captain is awarded a free throw .
toward the end of the game much thought is given to strategies to stop the clock by the losing team , and players are sometimes deliberately fouled in the hopes they will miss their free throws , thereby giving the other team a chance to score two or three points in a short period of time .
if the score is tied at the end of the regular game period , additional overtime periods are played until one team emerges as the winner .
the ball shouldn &apos;t hit my half of the court when i serve .
you opened the set with an ace .
i didn &apos;t try to return it because i thought it was out .
how do you slice the ball like that ?
flat-shots are the easiest shots to return .
i could see the ball spinning as it came towards me .
i ran forward to hit an overhead shot .
i tried to volley it back to you .
it &apos;s hard to put a lot of spin on the ball with a forehand shot .
a net-ball is when the ball hits the net , but doesn &apos;t go over it .
if you hit a let , you can serve again .
you can spin it more with a backhand .

do you enjoy tennis ?
i just need the second advantage point to win .

my favorite sports is tennis .
i &apos;ve got nobody to play tennis with lately .

robert beat richard by three games in the first and second sets .
catharine served an ace .
a net-ball means the other player scores .
both the players emphasized the power game of serve and volley and rallies were too short .
in the match , tommy haas from germany has fully demonstrated his superior skills in ground strokes .

britain has significantly fewer public courts than most other european countries and , as a result , significantly fewer top-class players .
the last home-grown winner of wimbledon was fred perry in the late 1930s .
only recently , after decades of mediocrity , has britain managed to find itself a couple of tennis players capable of challenging for top honors .
if you and your children want to see some grass court tennis and spot a few famous players you would be better off going to the queen &apos;s tournament , which takes place a couple of weeks before wimbledon
eighth seed marcelo rios won the salem open at hong kong , stopping rainer schuettler &apos;s winning streak at nine matches with a 7-7 , 6-2 victory .
tennis was a minor sport in germany until a somewhat awkward carrot-top by the name of boris becker won wimbledon in 1985 at 17 years of age and became the youngest player , first unseeded player and first german ever to do so .
in recent years , becker has assumed a mentoring and coaching role with younger german talent , like thomas haas and nicolas kiefer .
steffi graf has been the most consistently brilliant of all german tennis players , perhaps of all players anywhere .
stich won the davis cup for germany , but announced his retirement in 1997 , aged 28 .
after injuries kept her off the courts for much of 1998 , steffi returned triumphantly to paris to become the 1999 french open champion and to wimbledon where only lindsay davenport could stop her from winning her eighth wimbledon title .
thanks largely to the success of becker and graf . germany has become the biggest tennis market in the world , hosting plenty of top tennis tournaments .
the men &apos;s outdoor season gets under way in munich in late april , followed by the german open in hamburg in early may .
after a long period during which his career was in the doldrums , andre agassi started the new millennium right on top of his game with a success in the men &apos;s singles in the australian open championship , confirming his position at the top of the world rankings .
davenport , the 1998 u.s. open champion , surged back from a poor first set to force a tie breaker , in which she saved two match points .
williams broke davenport five times , ran off a 3-0 lead in the third set , won 89 percent of her net approaches and had 11 aces .
&quot; she got her first lead after going up , 15-0 , with williams serving in the ninth game of the third set , and then created a break point . &quot;
taking another huge step in his remarkable resurgence . pete sampras edged longtime rival agassi 6-7 , 7-6 , 7-6 , 7-6 in a quarterfinal thriller wednesday night in the u.s. open .
there are 4 major tennis tournaments . australian open , french open , wimbledon and the us open .
if sampras wins this year &apos;s us open , he will have won the us open 5 times .
sampras &apos; serve was just too good and his composure too cool .
the fight to serve or receive and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss .
the winner may make the loser choose first .
in doubles , the ball must first touch the server &apos;s right-hand court or center line and then the receiver &apos;s right-hand court or center line and then the receiver &apos;s right-hand court diagonally opposite or center line .
in spite of its european origin , ping-pong achieved its greatest popularity in asia .
before china introduced market reforms in the early 80s , its sports development was centered around table tennis .
as a result , from 1949 to 1966 when china set up its first state sports commission , the nation won 13 world titles , mostly in table tennis .
after the helsinki games , the country &apos;s only international success continued to come from table tennis .
but this sport did help china come out from the cold .
ping-pong diplomacy between chairman mao and richard nixon led to the resumption of ties between china and the united states .
and in 1979 , china was reinstated in the ioc .
at the seoul games , the host nation was delighted , and its closest neighbor shocked , when a member of the korean men &apos;s team , yoo nam-kyu , won the gold medal .
china fared better in the women &apos;s competition .
the match was two-out-of-three and the players split the first two games .
jacob found himself down.20 to 16 in the third but he scored the next six points to close the game .
once again , jacob proved that his fore-hand returns and backhand strokes are just too powerful .
he served with so much right english toward the end of the game that , as far as the opponent was concerned , it was hard put to it to counterattack .

football , known as &quot; soccer &quot; in american english , is the most popular sport in the world .
women &apos;s teams didn &apos;t become part of the olympic program until 1996 at atlanta .

the men &apos;s soccer is restricted to players under the age of 23 , although each team is allowed three older players .

at times they gain ground , but the defense of nigeria is well-organized .
no. 5 bent a ball around the defense wall .
he displayed admirable skills in passing , dribbling , and heading .
what impresses me most is that the goalkeeper is very skilled at catching high balls , saving shots , and diving at the opponent &apos;s feet .
the linesmen tell the referee which team should be awarded a throw-in , a corner kick or a goal kick .
they frequently committed off sides and fouls .
argentina takes the 4-3-3 formation while brazil takes 4-4-2 , so argentina is more aggressive .

i like the way the visiting team is playing .
the teamwork is good and the players are in excellent trim .
yes , they play an attacking game .
at times they gain ground . but the defence of the home team is well-organized .

the object of soccer is to drive the ball past the opposing goalkeeper into the goal for a score , worth one point .
if no goals are scored or the teams are tied at the end of regular play , the game can be decided by a kick from the penalty spot or extra playing time .
fullback is not a glamour position , as offensive opportunities are rare and defensive mistakes get magnified .
today , soccer-known as football everywhere in the world except in north america-is the most frequently played and most popular of all team sports .
soccer game arrived in brazil just before the turn of the 20th century , but the sport soon spread across the nation like wildfire .
soccer fans around the world were enthralled by the fluid attacking , skillful ball handling and clever playmaking of the brazilians during their finals matches in mexico .
in a game played and loved in hundreds of nations across the world , brazil-four times winner of the world cup-is pre-eminent .
the dark age of chinese soccer under the old state run system was the 1980s , most memorably a 1985 loss to lightweights hong kong , then a british colony , that led angry fans to smash cars and start fires .
china finally began to wean their players off state dependency with the introduction of club soccer in 1994 , following the example of japan a year before .
china reached the world cup finals for the first time on sunday by beating oman 1-0 in an asian qualifier , setting off a frenzy of celebration by hundreds of millions of ecstatic soccer fans around the country .
the victory was glorious redemption for china &apos;s soccer team which had become a national embarrassment after failing six times to reach the world cup finals .
china &apos;s 57-year-old croatian coach boar milutinovic , a master at shepherding lesser soccer nations to world cup success , was elated .
milutinovic , 57 , has borne the brunt of china &apos;s world cup anxieties .
he made headlines by vowing to jump off the great wall if his team stumbled .
as china prepared for its first world cup finals was clear that milutinovic &apos;s methods had paid dividends .
in women &apos;s soccer , wang xiaoying of jinan , on a breakaway , fired a shot toward the goal in the second overtime period but the ball went over the crossbar as jinan settled for a 0-0 tie against nanjing .
that 18 year old played left fullback , so her teammates relied on her throughout the game to defend against pressure , win the ball , restart the attack and know when to go forward .
toward the end of the game , her teammate , xiao huang , curled a free kick around a defensive wall and past goalkeeper li linmei .
17 minutes into the first half , fan zhiyi scored on a free kick .
30 seconds later , he scored again , this time on a header .
london is home to over a dozen professional foot ball clubs , the biggest of which are arsenal , chelsea and nottingham .
the removal of the hooligan element in the late eighties has led to more families coming to matches .
the most successful football players have become superstars commanding seven-figure salaries , while the top clubs are now stock market listed businesses .

there is a match at the stadium .
i can see basketball enjoys great popularity here , especially among young people .
that &apos;s true.that &apos;s partly because of the influence of the nba .

what just happened to the forward on the visitor &apos;s side ?
he &apos;s rad a foul called against him .
yes , but what did he do ?

hasn &apos;t dalian scored yet ?
no.our forwards have missed so many opportunities to score !
what a pity ! but it seems that the best forward , no.9 , isn &apos;t here.why not ?
he got suspended for this game .
this national sports meet is worth watching .
well , that &apos;s true .
it has produced a host of new asian , and chinese records .
i &apos;m most impressed by the girl who won the championship in the 100 meter dash .
well , she broke three world records this time . it &apos;s really an amazing achievement for a girl of 18 .
i didn &apos;t expect the visiting team to win the match .
according to the papers , the visiting side was a strong team in asia .
but the home team also did a good job .
yes , but they seemed to lack luck today .
i think the score of one-one didn &apos;t do us justice .
i hope our team won &apos;t disappoint us in the second half .
i hope so , too.but i don &apos;t think our center forward poses any threat up front .
we should get a replacement for him .
who is the man in the second lane ? do you know ?
you mean the man in the lead ?
he is ma ming , a gold medal winner .
i like the 100-meter relay best .
me , too . it &apos;s always one of the highlights of the match .
which team do you think will win ?
liaoning team , of course . it &apos;s the best team in china .
that little girl is holding a safe lead .
she has already won two gold medals .
why , she &apos;s weakening.what &apos;s wrong with her ?
she sprained her ankle.what a pity !
do you like sports ?
what sports do you go in for ?
i play volley-ball , and i enjoy badminton , too .
i &apos;m also keen on baseball , but not very good at it .
do you play football ?
yes , i do .
but i &apos;m just an ordinary amateur , and not a very good one at that .
what sport do you like best ? what &apos;s your favorite sport ?
i prefer swimming , and i belong to a swimming club .
i &apos;m simply mad about tennis , and my favorite winter sport is skiing .
i &apos;m interested in running . i used to be in the university track team .
i broke the university record in the women &apos;s 100 meter dash in 1992 .
but now i have lost interest .
what would you say are the most popular games in your country ?
well , i suppose they are table-tennis , basket-ball and swimming .
baseball is also a very popular outdoor game . it &apos;s played all the year round .
what about skating ?
i should say that &apos;s one of the most popular sports in our country too .
a sports meet will be held here next month .
the preliminary contest will take place on the 16th of the month .
the coaches , captains and referees are getting things ready .
the sportsmen and sports women are all well trained .
and they &apos;re making last minute preparations for the big event .
i hope some of them will set new national records .
i hope some of the athletes will break world records .
i hope our team will chalk up good results and be the champion of the weight-lifting contest .
i think going in for sports of one form or another will certainly do us good .
one can &apos;t keep on working day and night without rest .
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy .

the ball is going out of play for a goal-kick to our team .
our goalkeeper is running up , placing the ball , and booting it off to no.9
our defense seems to be well organized .
now no . 9 is taking the ball forward quickly , cutting in towards their goal .
their center-half comes across and tries to intercept him .
but he slips past and pushes the ball out to no.5 , our center-for-ward .
look , no.5 jumps and gets his head to it and oh , what a beautiful goal !
well , this is the first goal . we &apos;ve opened the scoring .
there goes the referee &apos;s whistle for a foul .
i think it must be that heavy tackle by their right bake on our no.7.
now the referee is placing the ball for a free kick .
a goal ! it &apos;s goal !
that &apos;s really a perfect goal !
he &apos;s got another point for us .
that puts us one point ahead .
how people are cheering at their wonderful team work !
they did spend quite some time practicing every day . they &apos;ve improved greatly their speed and tactics .
there goes the referee &apos;s whistle for the end of the match .
the final score is 2 to 1 in our favor .
the score was tied 1 to 1 when the first half was over .
both teams have the same score . the score is tied .
both teams have shown good sportsmanship .
the hardest ting to learn is to be a good loser .
a beautiful center !
a beautiful corner-kick !
a beautiful heading !
a clever pass to the forward !
a fumble !
a goal !
a wonderful passing he did .
ah , the ball &apos;s got into the net .
bond has just missed an open goal .
carson was offside .
dynamo haven &apos;t scored yet .
emerson kicked it deep into columbia territory .
gordon &apos;s near the penalty area .
he &apos;s got hold of the ball out on the touch line .
he &apos;s making a dash toward the goal .
he &apos;s pushing lovely passes up the middle and out to the wings .
he &apos;s now trying for a goal .
hey , what &apos;s wrong with the full-backs on the visiting side ?
how did fellows shape at center half ?
is jack playing ?
is this the last 15 minutes ?
it &apos;s half-time now .
sydney &apos;s defender is tackling thomas .

they &apos;re lining up in position for the kickoff .
they &apos;ve built a wall of players for a penalty shot .
they &apos;ve opened the scoring .
well done !
well , his header missed .
according to the papers . the visiting side is a strong team in europe .
actually , they were given several chances by the united , only they didn &apos;t succeed in scoring .
but that last goal was unfair .
sydney &apos;s defence looks disorganized .
good job they &apos;ve got a replacement for him .
i don &apos;t think their center forward possess any threat up front .
i hope our home side won &apos;t disappoint us in the second half .
i suppose it all depends on how they shape .

china &apos;s athletes have come a long way since 1952 when they appeared at the helsinki olympics .
then the chinese delegation , representing basketball , soccer and swimming , arrived late for the event and only one sportsman , a swimmer , managed to compete . he was eliminated in the heats .
this was a far cry from the 2000 sydney olympics at which china finished third overall behind the united states and russia with a tally of 59 medals , including 28 golds .
in 1958 people &apos;s republic of china withdrew from the olympic movement and all international federations .
13 years later , in november 1971 , ioc resolved to reinstate the people &apos;s republic of china .
the ioc , based in lausanne , switzerland , is the ruling body of the olympic movement .

chinese athletes at the seoul olympics in 1988 did not perform their best .
china managed to snatch only five gold medals from a total of 28 medals . china was ranked seventh in the number of medals won .
china was fourth in the number of gold medals won at the olympic games in barcelona and atlanta .
chinese swimmers did exceptionally well .
the famous &quot; five golden flowers &quot; including yang wenyi , zhuang yong , qian hong , wang xiaohong , grabbed four gold medals and one silver in barcelona .

fu mingxia became the youngest olympic champion at the age of 14 .
her success became a cover story in &quot; time &quot; magazine titled &quot; olympic height-china &apos;s gold medalist fu mingxia . &quot;
four years later , in atlanta , she went on to do well again , winning the women &apos;s platform and springboard diving competitions .
gao fenglian is the only female athlete in the world who had won heavyweight championships at three consecutive world judo championships in the 1980s .

tao luna won the first gold medal for china at the sydney olympic games by beating her rivals in the women &apos;s 10m air pistol event .

the short-track race was new to the winter olympic program and this action-packed sport immediately gained popularity at the 1992 albertville games .
the short-track program is made up of four events each for men and women the 500 metres , 1,000 metres , 1,500 metres and the relay .
athletes from china , korea and the united states stand out in these programs .
china saw ye qiaobo clinch the country &apos;s first winter olympics medal , a silver , in women &apos;s 500m speed skating . ye then took her second silver in the women &apos;s 1,000m speed skating and li yan added another silver for china in women &apos;s 500m short-track speed skating .
world overall short-track speed skating champion yang yang of china is tipped to clinch the first-ever winter olympic gold for the asian sports superpower in the women &apos;s 1,500 meters on wednesday .
yang yang , who has won the world overall title for five years in a row , finished on top of the season &apos;s overall standings as well as the 1,000m and 1,500m tables .
bulgaria &apos;s eugenia radanovich , who finished her world cup campaign second , overall , third in the 500m , fourth in the 1,000m and second in the 1,500m , is the main threat to yang .
south korea &apos;s ko gi-hun , who won the first two of the season &apos;s five world cup 1,500-metre rounds , and her compatriot joo min-jin , third overall , are also out to challenge yang .
in fact , a gold medal would be four years overdue for the 25-year-old from harbin , which is bidding for the 2010 winter olympics , as she all but triumphed at the last games in nagano .
the world champion is billed as yang yang so that she cannot be mistaken for her younger teammate yang yang , 24 , who also won the 500m silver in nagano and is back to go for gold in salt lake city .
yang led the 1,000m final , coming out of the final turn but she was disqualified for trying to block south korea &apos;s chun lee-kyung in a scramble toward the finish .
chun , the winner , has since retired .
the incident allowed yang &apos;s teammate and namesake to win the silver medal .
compared with the short distance , the long distance race is often decided by maneuvering rather than speed over the tiny 111.12-meter track .
the chinese have not been lucky in the event .
the elegant 17 year old chinese , chen lu , emerged as a third place finisher in the women &apos;s figure skating , winning china &apos;s first medal in olympic figure skating .
the first throw quad salchow , shen xue and zhao hongbo attempted was flawless .
their performance soon had the crowd on its feet before the short program was over .
one canadian choreographer said it was breathtaking to see how easily the pair performed the element .
whether the quadruple sal chow throw will show up in the free program will depend on what happens in the short program and what draw they get for the free program .
shen and zhao opened with beautifully-executed side-by-side triple toe loops which set the pace for the rest of their program .
unfortunately , they failed in their historical attempt to be the first skaters to land a throw quadruple sal chow .
regardless of the slight mishap , the audience was held breathless by the captivating performance filled with technical skills and majestic choreography .
if china apply for the olympic games successfully , as a host country , which gymnasiums do you prepare for the olympic games ?
when will be preparations begin early ?
what are the themes and mascot ?
why would the 2008 olympic games be hosted in beijing ?
what can the olympic games bring to beijing ?
if china apply for the olympic games successfully , then what &apos;s the effect in china ?
of all the internationalism manifesting themselves on this planet , i do not hesitate to proclaim olympics as the wisest and the most effective .
it tends to insure peace by giving those ancient and innate feeling of aggressiveness a nobler and more generous outlook .
olympics in a school of moral nobility and purity as well as of physical endurance and energy .
the olympic games help promote a better and more peaceful world .
the olympics are not simply athletic championships , but embody a sense of honor , a sense of art and literature , and a veneration of beauty .
the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle ; not to have conquered but to have fought well .
the bitterness of war can be lessened by the practice of sports and physical education .
the modern olympic games , like the greek olympics , include manliness , rhythm , art , beauty , and balance .
to ask the people of the world to love one another . is childishness . but to ask them to respect one another is not in the least utopia ;
however , in order to respect one another it is first necessary to know one another . through sports .
the whole trend of the modern olympics has been to promote mutual understanding and to bring the world together in friendly and efficacious collaboration .
by bringing nations together and giving people the opportunity to know and esteem each other and by forging ties of friendship , olympics realizes a vital work of peace .
sports should be conducted honorably in an atmosphere of moral purity .
olympics plays a vital part in the supreme task of binding together rival nations , and relegating the barbarism of wars to the past .
the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to participate .
let us play in order that we may live , not live in order that we may play ; and let us remember too , that it is better to compete with oneself than to watch others compete .
the practice of sport and participation in the olympic games . increase the physical , intellectual and spiritual value of the athlete .
without athletics , greek art and the greek conception of beauty would have been inconceivable .
peace is the product of a better world ; a better world is brought about by better individuals ; and better individuals , coubertin was convinced , are developed only in the give-and-take , the buffering and battering , the stress and strain of fierce competition .
within the olympic idea there inevitably develops a conflict between the past and the future , between the reality and the ideal .
the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle .
the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well .
a good athlete should set a good example and act as a role model to young people .
a good coach should set a good example and act as a role model to young athletes .
more than 100,000 grecians welcomed the return of the games on sunday , april 6 , 1896 - some 80,000 of them filling the olympic stadium while another 20,000. at least , lined the surrounding hills .
king george opened the games , welcoming 311 athletes from 13 countries .
since the games were not well publicized internationally , contestants were not nationally chosen but rather came individually and at their own expense .
some contestants were tourists who happened to be in the area during the games .
at the same time of the olympic games , paris was also hosting the word exhibition , an international fair of immense size .
because of the fair , the olympics were poorly organized and poorly publicized .
despite their sideshow status , the games attracted 1,225 athletes from 26 nations and enjoyed more publicity , if not bigger crowds , than in athens .
indeed , many of 1900 winners had no idea they were olympic champions until many years later , and some not at all .
one of the few highlights of the 1904 olympics was that , for the first time , gold , silver and bronze medals were awarded for first , second and third place .
it was in st. louis that basketball was seen for the first time in the olympic games , although only as a demonstration sport since it was just 13 years since the game invention and since america was the only country that had any familiarity with it whatsoever .
among the french no-shows was pierre de coubertin , the father of the modern olympics , who stayed in paris and received updates .
of the 12 nations and 617 athletes who participated , 525 were americans and 41 were from canada .
purists insist that the 1906 games , staged to mark the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the modern games , should not be considered olympic games because they fall outside the four year olympiad cycle .
for the first time ever , many of the national teams were officially sanctioned by their countries-as was the case with the team from the united states .
canadian william john sherring dropped from 135 pounds to 112 pounds in the process of training for the marathon .
when he did win the gold medal , the greeks gave him a statue of athena , and , presumably to fatten him back up , a lamb .

ioc employed an exclusively british jury of referees and officials to regulate the venues and interpret the rules .
british victories mounted on the scoreboard the final tally showed great britain with 145 medals , 98 ahead of the second-place united states team-the cries of unfavorable treatment mounted .
the stockholm games are best remembered for a young native american named jim thorpe .
he won the pentathlon and the very next day , while most of his competitors were recovering , thorpe went out and competed in the decathlon , easily winning the gold medal .
a year after his accomplishments , it was revealed that thorpe had received ＄ 25 a week playing baseball .
this went against the olympic amateur code and thorpe was asked to return his gold medals .
the swedes excelled in women gymnastics , diving , and the equestrian events-to say nothing of the job they did as a host .
world war i was to blame for the cancellation of the sixth olympiad .
it marked the first interruption of the olympics of the modern era .
the games came to antwerp , belgium , in the spring of 1920 , barely 20 months since the end of the war .
the olympic stadium 30 , 000 seating capacity was more than adequate , as the average price of admission , around 2.5 yuan , was beyond the reach of the majority of postwar belgians .
since many of the games participants were allied soldiers , germany , austria and bulgaria were not invited to participate in order to prevent hostilities .
austere as its conditions were , antwerp was rich in giving birth to a number of innovations that would be come olympic traditions . among them , olympic flag with its five colored rings and the olympic motto of citius , altius , fortius .
it was also at antwerp that the athlete oath was first taken .
winning five gold medals , the finnish athlete paavo nurmi became the undisputed star of the summer games in paris .
whereas in earlier olympiads americans shone mostly in track and field , in paris they took the lead in almost every venue .
france proudest moment came in the cycling competition when armand balnchonnet won the road race by an astonishing 10 minutes-the most lopsided breakaway in olympic history , before or after .
the german team , readmitted to the summer olympics after 16 years of olympic exile , had a victorious return with 10 golds , thus securing the runners-up position in the medals count .
amsterdam marked the first-ever olympic track and field competition for women . included on the program were the discus , the high jump , the 100-and 200-meter sprints , the 4 × 100-meter relay and the 800-meter run .
their appearance on the track met with more than a little resistance , most notably from coubertin himself and from the vatican .
it was at amsterdam , too , that the custom of torch-lighting was introduced .
in 1932 the olympic games were held for the second time in america , this time in los angeles .
twenty countries sent in their regrets at the last moment , unable to attend the 1932 games because of financial difficulties .
a trip to california was a long and expensive journey for many competing nations and there was a significant reduction in the number of competitors , in particular women , who were outnumbered ten to one by the men .
the japanese men swimming team brought in oxygen masks and won every gold medal but one in blistering times .
the lone non-japanese winner was american buster crabbe , whose victory in the 400-meter freestyle later won him a movie contract in hollywood .
having rejected a proposed boycott of the 1936 olympics , the united states and other western democracies missed the opportunity to take a stand that some observers at the time claimed-might have given hitler pause and bolstered international resistance to nazi tyranny .
the first two finishers of the high jump , cornelius johnson and david a. britton , both from the united states and both black , presented a problem for hitler , who refused to shake hands with negroes .
american journalists hailed the victories of jesse owens and other blacks as a blow to the nazi myth of aryan supremacy .
after a 12-year hiatus due to world war ii , the olympic games resumed in london in 1948 at a time when the united kingdom was digging out from the ravages of the war and food rationing was still very much the order of the day .
much of the british capital had been reduced to rubble in the blitz , but the ioc offer was accepted and the games went on successfully , without frills , and without invitations extended to germany and japan .
the british won just three gold medals , and were only 12th overall in the medal count , by far the worst home country showing in the games ? history .
when paavo nurmi , the flying finn , brought the olympic torch into the 70,000-seat olympic stadium , people expected that the finns would own the finishing tapes of distance3 events . as it turned out , not one finn won in any of the races .
the soviet union had only one gold medal to its credit , but the helsinki games is an unabashed preview of what was to come for the next 40 years-a medals showdown between the two superpowers , the united states and the ussr .
finland rose so well to the task of hosting the games that the 1952 helsinki olympiad has been generally looked back on as the most successful of them all .
it is also described as the last genuine festival of sport , with no hint of the major media circus that has been the norm ever since .
the five olympic rings were meant to represent the five continents yet the games had thus far been held only in europe and north america .
in the water , the aussie swimmers were in their own hemisphere .
they easily outdistanced all other nations , including a u.s. team that had dominated the swimming events in helsinki in 1952 .
for closing ceremony , the host adopted a proposal submitted by a 17 year old chinese athlete to break away the custom of parading into the stadium nation by nation and instead to have the athletes walk to the infield en masse in the spirit of unity and togetherness .
the rome olympics were the first to be thoroughly covered on broadcast television .
since there was no satellite to relay broadcasts across the atlantic , cbs flew tapes to new york city daily .
with victories in rome in 1960 and tokyo in 1964 , abebe bikila of ethiopia became the first man to win back-to-back olympic marathons .
both of his winning times were world bests .
he ran barefoot in rome .
a tragedy marred the 1960 cycling competition when danish cyclist knur jensen collapsed and died during the road race .
it was discovered later that drug use was a contributing factor .
1964 marks the first olympics in asia .
an estimated ＄ 3 billion was spent in tokyo renewal in preparation for the games and a record ＄ 60 million was budgeted for the games themselves .
perhaps the greatest showpiece project associated with the olympics was the hankinson bullet train-billed as the world &apos;s fastest-which began service between tokyo and osaka on october 1 , nine days prior to the start of the games .
the toughest test for japanese diplomacy came in a time-honored sport in japan , namely judo , when the hometown favorite , akio kaminaga , lost to a 267-pound giant dutchman named anton geesink .
the japanese audience were naturally embarrassed as they watched in disbelief .
however , it did not take long before they gathered themselves and politely cheered the foreign conqueror .
never before had an olympics been held at such an altitude of 7,347 feet , the highest by far in olympic annals .
the thin air proved to be easy to slice through .

eight palestinians , calling themselves the black september terrorists , broke into the munich olympic village and took nine israeli athletes hostage .
all nine hostages died in a shootout between german police and the terrorists .
among those that had problems with outcomes and medal presentations was the pakistani field hockey team which lost the final to germany .
the pakistani team members stormed the judges table and poured water on officials , after which they took the victory stand and refused to stand at attention during the playing of the german national anthem .

despite the boycott , the moscow olympics saw dozens of records fall and memorable performances by romanian gymnast nadia comaneci , cuban boxer teofilo stevenson and soviet swimmer vladimir salnikov .
the city of los angeles joins london , berlin and paris as the only cities to have hosted two olympic games .
the soviet union , in retaliation for the american boycott four years ago , elected not to send a team to the united states , citing concerns over the performance of the l.a. olympic organizing committee .
the los angeles games were attended by the chinese for the first time since 1952 .
shooter xu haifeng became china &apos;s first ever olympic gold medalist .
juan antonio samaranch , presiding over his first olympic games after succeeding lord killanin , presented the gold medal to xu , saying it was &quot; a big day in china &apos;s 5,000 year history &quot; .

ten days into the games , canadian ben johnson beat defending champion carl lewis in the 100-meter dash with a world record time of 9.79 .
two days later , however , johnson was stripped of his gold medal and sent packing by the ioc when his post-race drug test indicated steroid use .
a proud man , an embattled man , mr. samaranch was seated in his barcelona office , his lips trembled slightly .
this is the room that has a sweeping view of the hometown he transformed by steering the 1992 olympics here .
this was also the year the ioc threw open the gates to professional athletes after 96 years of high minded opposition .
basketball was the chief beneficiary as america &apos;s popular ream team of nba all-stars easily won the gold .
as muhammad ali , the former world heavyweight boxing champion , bent to ignite the olympic flame , his hand shook .
so too were those of the millions of the audience in the stadium and before the t.v. sets .

sydney has long been famous as australia &apos;s first capital city , but its fame was substantially increased in the year 2000 with the staging of the olympic games held during september and october .
perec did not compete in any events in sydney , fleeing to france just hours before her much-anticipated clash with cathy freeman in the women 400m sprint an event freeman won .
in spite of the fact that the international olympic committee did not sanction a winter olympics until 1925 , a gathering of 16 national teams at the international winter sports week in 1924 in chamonis , france , however , would be inevitably recognized as the first official winter games .
the scandinavians , particularly the norwegians , demonstrated their dominance in all five disciplines-bobsled , ice hockey , figure skating , speed skating , and nordic competition .
with the first olympic winter games an enormous success , it was no surprise that the st. moritz games attracted an 84 percent increase in the number of participants including a 100 % increase of female athletes .
numerous guests of honor traveled to st. moritz , the beautiful tourist resort of switzerland , to attend the opening ceremony and the competitions that followed .
because of the unseasonably mild weather conditions caused by the warm wind that swept the swiss mountains from the south , some events were disrupted and the 10,000m speed skating race was canceled altogether .
due to the worldwide depression , only four hockey teams , germany , poland , canada and the united states , competed .
each side played the other teams twice .
canada beat the u.s. in game 2 would have resulted in a third contest to decide the gold medal .
in figure skating , sonja henie of norway was the unanimous choice of the seven judges .
already sonja henie imitators were springing up , wherever figure skating was appreciated .
ballangrud and vasenius , paired together , raced neck and neck for 4000 meters before the norwegian began to pull away .
the british ice hockey team scored a major upset by beating canada for the gold .
it was later discovered that eight of the british players actually lied and played hockey in canada .
nevertheless , britain was allowed to keep the gold because all eight had been born in england .
seeking to put on its best face and suppress any possible negative reporting of the nazi administration of the games , germany allowed only german photographers to record olympic events .
only after extensive censorship by the propaganda ministry were &quot; appropriate &quot; pictures released to the international communities .
st. moritz , switzerland was again chosen as the venue .
the town had gained olympic experience as host of the 1928 winter games , and its facilities came out of the war unscathed requiring only minor touch-ups .
a member of the french underground during world war ii , henri oreiller was a cocky , clowning fellow who warned the other downhill skiers he was so confident of victory that they needn &apos;t bother racing against him .
concerns over oslo &apos;s ability to stage the games were unfounded : all the facilities , including the newly introduced men &apos;s and women &apos;s giant slalom and women &apos;s 10-kilometer cross-country skiing , met the high expectations of athletes and officials alike .
jeanette altwegg , representing great britain , placed only fourth in free-skating .
however , she had built up such a large lead during the compulsory figures that she won anyway .
home of the winter olympics in 1956 , cortina d &apos; ampezzo is a ski resort in the italian alps . it is a quintessential european town , straight from a james bond movie .
until recently , the town was one of those hidden gems , unknown to most , with friendly service , short lines , and old world charm .
winning all seven games in the ice hockey tournament , the soviet union concluded their olympic debut in impressive style .
in the final , the soviet team beat the eventual bronze medal winner canada , 2-0 , thus effectively ending canada &apos;s longstanding dominance in this event .
spectators at squaw valley were the first to watch the biathlon as an olympic discipline , a sport , which had been recognized in scandinavia for many years . it is not surprising , therefore , that the first olympic champion was a swede - klas lestander .
since the 4 × 10 kilometer relay is the only skiing event in which the participants actually race against each other , it is also the only event which has the potential for a truly exciting finish .
such a finish occurred at squaw valley , when finland and norway took turns to lead in a dramatic race ending in finland &apos;s victory .
spring like temperatures plagued innsbruck both before and during the games , forcing the austrian military to carry in over 50,000 cubic meters of snow from higher elevations .
whatever the reason , from 1964 in innsbruck , austria , through 1968 in grenoble , france , through 1972 in sapporo , japan , the winter games skated along with hardly any political or social unrest .
jean-claude killy of france emerged as the popular hero of the 1968 games , winning gold medals in all three alpine skiing events .
the handsome and charming killy won the downhill and giant slalom with relative ease , but appeared to have been beaten by austria &apos;s karl schranz in the slalom .
however , schranz was disqualified for missing a gate after extensive study of videotape by officials .
despite the 4-5 defeat at the hands of the eventual silver medalists , czechoslovakia , the soviet ice hockey team went on to successfully defend their olympic title .
just as canada dominated olympic ice hockey from 1920 through 1952 , so the former soviet union has been in control most of the time since then .
of the 47 men &apos;s cross-country events that have been held in the olympics , 46 of them have been won by sweden , norway , finland and the u.s.s.r.
the only gold medalist from a non-nordic nation has been franco nones , a 27-year-old customs officer from the village of catella di fiemma of italy .
it is true that nones was trained in northern sweden by a swedish coach , but his victory was nonetheless a major surprise , particularly coming as it did in the first event of the 1968 winter games .
sapporo had previously bid two times and its persistence paid off when xi winter games was awarded for the first time to an asian country .
japanese athletes took the chance to perform in front of their home crowds , and dazzled with a complete medal sweep of the 70-meter ski-jumping event .
participants of luge , known as sliders , careen down the course feet first , guiding the luge not with their hands but with their feet .
luge has the reputation of being one of the most dangerous sports in the olympics .
the gold for 2-man luge went to italy &apos;s paul hidgartner and walter plaikner
the russians dominated in ice dancing , which made its first appearance here at innsbruck , while the dutch continued their long-standing success in the speed skating events .
dorothy hamill &apos;s victory in figure skating was particularly exciting for her coach , carlo fassi , who achieved a unique double , having also coached the men &apos;s winner , john curry .
with five minutes to play steve yates tied the score twenty-four seconds later jon lanee knocked the disc into the net again to give his team their fourth straight set of gold medals in ice hockey .
nestled in the northeastern portion of the adirondack wilderness of new york state , the rugged mountain scenery , heavy winter snows and a pleasant summer climate combined to make lake placid a popular tourist year-round resort .
unfortunately , however , in 1980 , the city found itself in great shortage of snow and had to resort to artificial snow at an exorbitant amount of money .
freestyle skating in pairs competition requires combinations of spins and jumps , connected by forward and backward turns , spirals lifts and other maneuvers .
irina rodnina and alexander zaitsev won the pairs title ahead of compatriots marina cherkassova and sergei shakhray .
1984 saw the winter games held in the balkans for the first time .
who would imagine that a decade later the city &apos;s olympic sports facilities were reduced to rubble during the 1992-1995 bosnian war ?
movements and steps in ice dancing are similar to those of ballroom dancing . in competition , couples skate three compulsory dances , an original set dance and a four minute free skating program .
british ice dance pair jayne torvill and christopher dean achieved a perfect score for artistic presentation-all nine judges awarded them the maximum six points-and their performances brought the house down . they were the undisputed stars in sarejeve .
the 1988 official mascots for the calgary games , two polar bears called hidy and howdy . were conceived by the canadian designer sheila scott .
in the bobsled , the stories were not those of the eventual winners , the soviets in the two-man and the swiss in the four-man , but rather of the jamaicans having bobsled team at all and of prince albert of monaco competing .
an elaborate ceremony dubbed festival of the senses &quot; officially marked the beginning of the xvi winter games .
the athletes paraded into the stadium led by the greek team , in honor of the founding of the olympic games , with the host nation , france , marching in last .
at the 1992 olympic winter games , the ussr was no more ; athletes from the world &apos;s largest country now competed as a &quot; unified team . &quot;
the 17th olympic winter games were held in 1994 only 2 years after the albertville games , because of the international olympic committee decision to switch to a 2-year cycle between summer and winter olympics .
this new measure was prompted by the need to attract more television audience and advertising revenue .
the previous arrangement of having both games in the same year was not ideal from marketing point of view .
before its appointment as the site of the xvii winter games lillehammer was a town of 20,000 inhabitants , hardly known outside norway .
now it is a household name .
finishing second to fellow u.s. skater tara lipinski , michelle kwan won a silver medal at the 1998 nagano olympics .
lu chen of china received the bronze .
kwan &apos;s parents recognized their daughter &apos;s enthusiasm in figure skating early on and did everything they could to nurture her talent .
at the 1998 games in nagano some 72 nations competed in 68 events .
a total of eight sports were included in the winter olympics in 1998 : biathlon , bobsled , curling , ice hockey , luge , figure skating , speed skating , and skiing .
short-track , often dubbed a &quot; roller derby on ice &quot; for its spectacular show of crashes , falls and disqualifications , has been led by asian nations including china , south korea and japan as well as canada and the united states .
french judge marie-reine le gougne sparked one of the biggest controversies in olympic skating history when she cast a crucial vote in favor of russians elena berezhnaya and anton sikharulidze over canadians jamie sale and david pelletier .
the russians won 5-4 despite an obvious technical error .
&quot; we were thrilled by your spirit of fair play and brotherhood , &quot; international olympic committee president jacques rogge told the crowd of 55,000 . &quot; keep this flame alight . promote the olympic dream in your countries you are the true ambassadors of the olympic values &quot;
rogge also thanked the security forces that kept the games safe at the cost of about $ 310 million , a bill that increased following the sept . 11 terrorist attacks .
the world &apos;s eyes are now turned to the northern italian town of turin , the host of the next winter games .
seven years ago in monte carlo , and against the wishes of ioc president juan antonio samaranch , beijing suffered defeat by sydney for the right to stage the 2000 games .
sydney &apos;s bid was helped by the fact that no games had been held in the southern hemisphere since 1956 and that it has no history of terrorism .
in 1999a scandal was revealed .
several cities , including salt lake city , utah , and sydney , had bribed ioc officials to vote for their bids .
a major investigation ensued in an attempt to clean up the bidding process and to restore the good name of the ioc .
after sitting out the contest for the 2004 games , which were awarded to athens , greece , beijing came back this time with a new and improved bid .
the beijing olympic committee delegation arrived in moscow sunday , confident that lessons from their failed 2000 had been learned .
the officials are completing preparations for a final pitch ahead of friday &apos;s election of the 2008 host city .
beijing remains the front-runner ahead of toronto and paris , with istanbul , turkey , and osaka , japan , as long-shots .
the ioc met in moscow for two landmark announcements-the first the election of the 2008 host and the second the replacement of outgoing president juan antonio samaranch .
bid officials told ioc delegates in moscow that staging the olympics would help to narrow the distance between china and the outside world , and the country &apos;s media have suggested that success would demonstrate that china has come of age as a member of the international community .
the ioc has to think carefully about many factors before deciding which bid will be successful .
out of 122 ioc members , 105 voted in friday &apos;s secret ballot that ended after second round when beijing collected a winning majority of 56 votes . toronto finished a distant second with 22 votes .
paris was unable to convince members to keep the olympics in europe for a third straight time after the 2004 summer games in athens and 2006 winter games in turin , italy .
germany , britain , italy , russia and spain are planning their bids for the 2012 games .
the attraction and far-reaching significance of staging the games in a country which has the world &apos;s largest population , as well as huge economic potential , won the day .
firecrackers crackled through the night in tiananmen square , the proposed site for beach volleyball .
mass-circulation beijing newspapers were carrying banners in red used only for extremely rare occasions of jubilation , and the beijing youth daily published a &quot; special olympics issue , &quot; with 24 colorful pages devoted almost entirely to the triumph in moscow .
the people &apos;s band of china , the nation &apos;s central bank , said it would issue 60,000 commemorative silver coins sunday , selling at 10 yuan a piece .
the coin would sport the letter &quot; v &quot; for victory on the one side , while the reverse would show the hall of prayer for good harvest at beijing &apos;s temple of heavena hint at achievements made and achievements still to come .
while it is always a great honor to be the host for the olympic games , it has also been a very complicated and increasingly expensive business to stage them .
each new opening ceremony is watched by millions of viewers and seems to outdo the one before it for spectacular entertainment and effect .
the chinese government has pledged to spend 20 billion u.s. dollars building sports complexes and refurbishing the beijing infrastructure .
there are plans for a new exhibition center with twin skyscrapers that could be taller than any in the world about 3.7 billion u.s. dollars will go to ease traffic , tripling the length of the city &apos;s highways and quadrupling the capacity of its subway system .
there are few venues that are currently up to standard , so the center of the sporting side of the bid is a giant olympic park on the northern outskirts of the city .
at the moment the site is a mixture of fields , old buildings and a few homes , but the vision is to turn the land into a futuristic sports complex of stadiums , facilities lakes and greenery .
the major venues to be built in the olympic green include : national stadium : with a seating capacity of 80,000 people , it will be the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies , athletics and football finals .
national indoor stadium : with a seating capacity of 18,000 people , it will be the venue for gymnastics , handball , and volleyball finals . it will be a multi-functional structure .
national swimming center : with a seating capacity of 18,000 people , it will be the main venue for swimming competitions . it will serve as a public sports center after the olympic games .
other related facilities to be built in the olympic green include : olympic village : with complete supporting facilities .
the olympic village will contain 360,000 square meters of apartments available to the athletes , coaches and team officials during the games .
these apartments will be sold as commercial housing after the games .
other facilities : a number of other buildings will also be planned and built in the green , which will serve as the competition venues for table tennis , badminton , fencing and wrestling and as the main press center and the international broadcasting center . after the games , these buildings will be turned into convention and exhibition centers and cultural facilities , such as capital youth palace and urban planning exhibition hall , etc .
in addition , other supporting service facilities will also be available for accommodation , commerce , and offices , etc .
the design of the olympic village for the 2000 games in sydney is extremely eco-friendly .
it features solar street lighting and the recycling of waste water for garden irrigation .
beijing promises to address its environmental issues and to hold an equally green games .
striving for an all-round and concerted development in china &apos;s sports : china will endeavor to drastically upgrade the management skills and the scientific research work of its competitive sports , creating a strong team of organizers and managers for sports activities , a large number of researchers and coaches who excel in selecting and training athletes , and a large number of outstanding and promising athletes . while aiming at participating in all the sports and more events at the 2008 olympic games , china will make efforts for a breakthrough in the total number of gold medals and a noticeable improvement in the overall strength of the country &apos;s sports . china will implement the &quot; national sports for all program &quot; to improve the physical quality and fitness of the whole population . china will enhance sports legislation , further promote the reform of its administration and speed up its socialization and industrialization so as to achieve a sustainable , speedy and heal thy development of sports .
efforts will be made to train more managing personnel who understand international practice in city administration and economic management , who have international vision , and who are able to establish direct contact and exchange relations with foreign specialists and professional organizations . specialists , who have the knowledge of international sports and olympic affairs , international law , international business , international finance and insurance , electronic information technology , environment protection technology , will also be trained .
government officials at all levels and leaders of enterprises should enrich their olympic related knowledge and intensify their study of market operation , international business and law so as to update their knowledge structure and better their competence .

a dive consists of the starting position , the run , the hurdle , the take-off , the execution , and the entry .
what are the six official groups of dives ?
the groups are forward dives , backward dives , reverse dives , inward dives , twist dives , and armstand dives .
are all six groups of dives practiced on the springboard ?
no. the armstand dive isn &apos;t practiced on the springboard . but all six groups of dives are practiced from the highboard .
what is a twist dive ?
a twist dive is a forward , backward , reverse or inward dive combined with a twist .
in the final of a competitor , how many dives does a competitor take ?
in the highboard event , men take ten dives , women take eight dives .
for standing dive , the diver stands at the end of the springboard or platform with the body straight , head raised , arms at the side or up or outstretched .
in arm stand dive , on the other hand , the diver must be balanced and straight in a handstand before takeoff .
the required dives are comprised of a forward dive , a backward dive , a reverse dive , and a forward dive with a half twist .
these dives may be performed straight , piked or with tuck .
14-year-old xiong ni and louganis were neck to neck going into the final dive of the platform competition .
louganis had to make a near perfect dive to take the gold and he did it with the most difficult one in his repertoire , a 1-1 / 2 somersault in tuck position , allowing him to edge xiong ni by a mere point to win the gold .
in springboard competition , louganis hit the diving board before he hit the water on a reverse 1-1 / 2 somersault dive , the result being not only a lousy dive , but a nasty gash on the head and fear of serious injury .
the american diver greg louganis remained unbeaten from the three-meter springboard as well as from the ten-meter highboard , and wowed the crowd with his precision .
after gao min and fu mingxia had captured the women &apos;s springboard and highboard titles respectively , sun shuwei claimed a third gold for china with his win in the men &apos;s highboard event . in the men &apos;s springboard , tan liande had to settle for silver .
the australians received marks of 7.5 and 8.0 for their final effort , and a forward 2 1 / 2 somersault with two twists that equaled the highest degree of difficulty of any dive in the event .
li and sang sank the women &apos;s field with four 10s on their second effort , creating hardly a splash as their lithe bodies knifed through the water .
he was second after the third of five dives , only to fall out of a medal spot with an inward , 2 1 / 2 somersault that drew scores no higher than 6.5 for execution .
divers were again given a scare on the opening two days of the sydney games when china lost two synchronized titles and the women &apos;s 10m platform title , the event the chinese had been winning at every olympic since 1984 .
but they came back strong taking all five remaining gold medals .
twenty-three year-old legend fu mingxia and xiong ni came out of retirement and successfully defended their olympic title , in the women &apos;s and men &apos;s 3m springboards .
fu became the first woman diver to win golds at three consecutive olympics and xiong was the first diver to win medals at four olympics .

table tennis is a game played indoors by two or four people .
the game is played on a table of 2.74m × 1.53m.
the aim of the game is to win points .
the player hits ball after it has touched the table once on his own side of the net so it goes straight back over the net to touch the table on his opponent &apos;s side until one player can not return the ball this way and loses the point .
the first side to score 21 points wins the game-unless the score reaches 20 : 20 , in which case one side must give a 2 points lead to win .
a match can be one game , the best of three games or the best of five .
volleyball is a six-a-side court game which is similar to badminton and tennis . however , the game is played by hand .
serving and volleying are the basic elements of the game .
the object is to return the ball across the net .
the rally continues until one team fails to return the ball or lets it hit the ground on its side of the court .
if the volley is won by the serving team , it wins one point .
it is usually played on an indoor court eighteen meters long and nine meters wide .
the court is divided by a centre line and each half has marked across it an attack line three meters from the centre line . at each end of the court behind the back line is a service area .
above the centre line is a net . for men the net is 2.42 meters high . for women it is 2.24 meters high .
the game is played with a round leather ball .
the modern game was devised by an american , william g. morgan , in 1895 four years after james w. nesmith had invented basketball .
the international volleyball federation was founded in 1947 .
in 1964 it became a full olympic sport for both men and women , dominant nations in world volleyball are china , cuba , italy , brazil and russia .
basketball was invented almost a hundred years ago by an american lecturer , dr. james naismith .
now basketball &apos; s international federation has over a hundred and fifty affiliated nations and regions , each with its own domestic leagues .
these nations also compete against each other at the club and nation level in events such as the olympic games , world championships and european champions cup or cup-winners cup .
basketball is an indoor game played by two teams , each consisting of ten players . of these ten players only five from each team can be on the court , playing , at any one time .
a full game lasts for forty minutes . however , when the referee blows his whistle the electronically controlled clock stops so that in fact a game will run for approximately one and a quarter hours including the halftime break .
the idea of the game is simply to score more baskets and therefore more points than the other team .
this can be done in a variety of ways .
a normal shot is worth two points ; penalty shots are worth one point each , the last type of shot is a long range shot taken from behind an arc which is 6.70m from the basket . this is worth three points , as it is possible to score one , two or three points with a single shot , the lead can change sides with virtually every basket .
tennis is a game played by two or four players on a rectangular court .

a third backcourt area extends from the service line to the base line .
the modern game of tennis originated in england in the eighteen seventies .
the first wimbledon championships were held in eighteen seventy-seven .
the scoring system of love , fifteen , thirty , forty , deuce , was based on that of &quot; royal tennis &quot; .
the itf was founded in nineteen twelve , in paris .

badminton is a game played by two or four players on a rectangular court with a high net across the middle .
the main aim in badminton is simply to hit the shuttlecock to the floor on the opponent &apos;s side of the net .
a fault is an infringement that ends a rally .
if the serving side makes a fault , the service passes to the other side . if the receiving side makes a fault , the serving wins the point .
in doubles and men &apos;s singles this total is 15 points . in women &apos;s singles , it is 11 points .
a match is won by the first side to win two games .
modern soccer is a sport that was devised by the british , refined by scottish players and coaches .

the 90-minute game is divided into 45-minute halves with an interval of 10-minutes .
when two teams get tied at the end of the 90-minute game , whether to adopt a play-off or not depends on the competition system .
few people , if asked , could name a single country where soccer isn &apos;t played , watched and enjoyed .
soccer is a religion in many regions where the fortunes of teams excite passions reserved for few other things in life .
results matter .
soccer is fast , and has dramatic action . it utilizes individual skill within a team framework .
these characteristics have helped to spread the game rapidly since the last century .
the game is not restricted by social or cultural boundaries .
on the contrary , it has become a link between societies .
the world cup is a prime example of such unity .
soccer is the world &apos;s common language , perhaps even more so than music .
as the legendary liverpool club manager , bill shankly , was to say : &quot; some people think that soccer is a matter of life and death . it &apos;s more serious than that . &quot;
one of the first things that people studying english learn is that the game they call football is called soccer in north america .
soccer has been popular for more than 100 years , and today it is probably the most popular sport in the world .
every four years , teams from all over the world compete in the famous world cup .
the cup is a series of games in which teams from many countries play to see which is the best .
by one estimate , almost one billion people watched the 1982 championship game on television .
people in asia had to get up in the middle of the night to see italy beat west germany on tv in a game played in spain .
the world cup began in montevideo , uruguay , in 1930 .
at the time , it did not seem like a true world competition since only thirteen teams decided to play , and eight of them were from south america .
the team from uruguay won .
in 1934 and 1938 , the cup was held in europe .
more than thirty teams played in each of these competitions , and italy won both of them .
the larger number of teams meant that some rules had to be changed .
there were too many teams playing , so they had to have elimination matches first .
some of the games were played in countries other than host countries . this system is still used today , and only the sixteen teams left after elimination actually compete for the cup .
there were no world cup championships in 1942 or 1946 because of world war ii . the cup itself was hidden during the war .
this beautiful cup is about ten inches high and has the shape of nike , the greek goodness of victory , on it . it is named for a person who helped organize the world cup , jules rimet .
when the cup play started again in 1950 , there was little enthusiasm . it was like 1928 all over again : only thirteen teams competed , the games were in brazil , and uruguay won .
but the worldwide interest in soccer came back during the next four years . by the time west germany won in switzerland in 1954 , millions of people wanted to go to the matches .
in 1958 , when the games were held in sweden , interest was once again very high . fifty-three teams wanted to compete .
many elimination matches were held in different parts of the world to get the number of teams down , and only the last sixteen teams went to sweden .
this was the first time that the world saw pele . his team , from brazil , won the cup for the first time that year , and pele become the greatest soccer player of all time .
in the past thirty years , soccer has became the sport of the world . each world cup is more successful than the last .
since 1966 , probably one-quarter of the world has listened to or watched the championship game .
in the 1970s , pele retired from the national team of brazil and became a professional player for a team to new york .
soccer wasn &apos;t very popular in the united states at that time . few north americans knew about this fastmoving sport .
there was no money to pay professional players , and there was little interest in soccer in the high schools and colleges .
when pele and other international stars began playing in various us cities , people saw how interesting the game was and began to go to the matches .
today there is a professional league called the north american soccer league .
it is common for important games to have fifty to sixty thousand fans .
support from the fans is important to soccer .
the fans cheer enthusiastically for their favorite players and teams , who respond by playing better than before .
in most world cups the home team or the team from the host country , usually plays better than most people expect .
in 1996 , 1974 , and 1978 , the home team of england , west germany , and argentina all won the world cup .
it is common for people to close their stores and stop working during games .
some people feel that their national soccer team represents their country &apos;s honor .
north american teams have never been as good as teams from other parts of the world , but this may change .
many north american high schools and colleges now have teams , and student interest is high .
fans in the united states enjoy sports which are hard and fast , and u.s. interest in soccer play will surely grow .
as all soccer fans know , the greatest teams don &apos;t always win .
their fans &apos; enthusiasm and their own desires sometimes help teams play better than normal .
in the 1950 world cup , for example , most people thought that the team from england was the best in the world . the u.s.team surprised everyone by winning its match .
that loss stopped england from winning the cup .
this , of course , did not mean that the u.s. team was the best in the world . the united states lost to chile in its next game . then the chilean team lost to spain , and spain finished fourth in the final result . uruguay won the cup .
the world cup is called that because teams from every continent have played in it . however , since the cup began , all of the winning teams have been from europe or south america .
teams from asia or africa always do well , but they haven &apos;t yet won .
mexico played surprisingly well in the 1970 cup , which it hosted , but it wasn &apos;t among the final four teams .
the largest crowed ever to attend a soccer match was at the world cup final in rio de janeiro , brazil , on july 16 , 1950 . 199 , 854 fans watched uruguay defeat brazil by a score of 2 - 1 .
the following incidents show how serious some people are about soccer .
during the 1960s , a player for a team from derby , england , was fined two dollars for smiling at a referee during a match .
in another incident in greece , a referee feared an angry crowd after match , so he dressed himself as a catholic priest and tried to escape to athens by ship . the fans found out where he was and threw fruit at him before his ship sailed .
american football , not to be confused with the football called soccer , is the american national sport .
it developed from the british game of rugby and , although it is played in no other country in the world , it excites tremendous enthusiasm .
intercollegiate games are great social occasions . more than 100 thousand mothers and fathers , brothers and sisters , students and football fans from the general pubic , crowd into the huge , luxurious stadiums .
during a recent college final in the rose bowl at pasadena , california , there were severe earthquake tremors , but nobody noticed !
then there is the razzamatazz - the splendidly-trained brass bands , the teams of pretty girls twirling batons and dressed in fancy costumes who march like well-drilled soldiers during the half-time show , the cheerleaders urging the fans to shout encouragement or applaud good play .
the method of scoring in american football is the same as in rugby . players try to carry the ball over the opponents &apos; line and then to earn more points by kicking the ball between the upright goal posts above the bar .
but that is where the likeness between the two games ends .
american football has a reputation for being a brutal and dangerous game . this reputation is not really deserved .
the players hurl themselves at each other fiercely , but today their uniforms and helmets are so skillfully padded that there are few serious injuries .
by comparison , the rugby player is almost naked , having only thin jersery and a pair of shorts to protect him from his opponents &apos; boots and tackling .
the football coach is a very important member of the college staff - more important than the professors , some say !
the coach picks promising football players from the high schools , and recommends that they be given scholarships .
this is the only way some boys from poor families with no intellectual background can get to college .
quite a few of these students go on to become professional football players .
the names of professional football clubs are as well known to americans as professional soccer clubs are to europeans and south americans .
the americans are addicted to craze . when they take something up , they do so wholeheartedly , and often the rest of the world follows their lead .
jogging is an example of this .
the americans now have another craze , a game which most other countries call &quot; football , &quot; but which they call soccer .
soccer is spreading like wildfire through all the states and gaining in popularity on baseball .
it is being run by big businesses and tv public . they are employing famous fashion designers to design novel uniforms for the players.they have introduced a musical background to the games , and there is a big screen in the stadium which explains to spectators that is happening .
most important , they have hired , at enormous expense , famous coaches and players from europe and south america .
they have also changed some of the rules , including the offside rules to make the game more exciting .
soccer games can now draw crowds of over 70 thousand in cities where baseball attracts a mere 20 thousand spectators .
the soccer stadiums are much more luxurious than the vast majority of european and south american league grounds .
there is a seat for everyone and a parking lot for 25 thousand cars .
soccer is being brilliantly promoted , like any other promising american product .
the lean figure at the end of the runway tried to calm his angry nerves .
there were the olympic games , and soon it would be his moment to take center stage .
with his thoughts focused on simply doing his best , he had no idea that he was about to be at the center of a freak moment in sports history .
but conditions were all coming together for him at just the right time .
all that lay between the takeoff board and the end of the long-jump pit was the thin air of mexico city .
at such a high altitude , the air would give less resistance to his jump than at lower elevations .
and there was a gentle tailwind that would push him slightly through the air .
at the time of his jump , this breeze would reach two meters per second .
if it increased even slightly , the jump would be considered wind-aided , and it would not count as a world record .
bob beamon would not have been the logical choice for this historic moment .
he was a good jumper , but he did not rank with the greatest .
during these 1968 olympics , he had barely dodged disaster and had qualified for the finals only on his last preliminary jump .
there were many other jumpers with better form who were more consistent than bob .
while others pranced down the runway with carefully measured strides , beamon was not always sure whether he would be jumping off his left foot or his right .
now it was time for beamon to jump .
when he tore off down the runway , he seemed to be driven by an extra burst of energy .
after running faster than he had ever before in his life , bob hit his takeoff perfectly and soared .
he didn &apos;t splash into the sand until he was dangerously near the end of the pit .
aware of what had happened , the crowd screamed its approval .
when he heard that his distance had been 8.9 meters , beamon clapped his hands over his eyes , collapsed , and kissed the ground .
in the words of a competitor , beamon had &quot; destroyed the event . &quot;
knowing their best efforts would look foolish compared to beamon &apos;s , the rest of the jumpers could hardly fire up for their turns .
the united states &apos; jumper had sailed 29 feet , 2.5 inches , almost 2 feet beyond the old world record !
some called it the greatest achievement in athletic history and predicted the record would last well into the next century .
three years later , a 10 - year - old boy took a tape measure out into his yard .
stretching out the tape , he carefully measured 29 feet , 2.5 inches on the grass .
young carl lewis looked from one end of the mark to the other , eyes huge with wonder that a human could jump so far .
although he did not realize it , carl was sizing up the task that was in front of him .
in 10 years , he would begin a relentless assault on that &quot; untouchable &quot; record .
several years later , carl met his dad &apos;s hero , jesse owens .
the buckeye bullet from ohio state university had been the greatest track and field star in united states &apos; history .
it was owens who had shocked adolph hitler &apos;s powerful german team in the 1936 olympics by winning four gold medals in track and field .
as he shook hands with the great owens , lewis stared into the face of a second legend .
no man had ever challenged owen &apos;s record of four gold medals in track and field in one olympics .
like the legendary jump of bob beamon , the legend of jesses owens was so great that only carl lewis would consider going after it .
if a mad scientist tried to use principles of inherited traits to create a spectacular sprinter and leaper , he might well have considered pairing a couple from tuskegee institute in alabama .
evelyn lawler was ahead of her time in women &apos;s sports .
she devoted full effort to such activities as basketball and track and had placed sixth in the hurdles during the 1951 pan american games .
had it not been for an injury , lawler would have had a good chance of competing in the 1952 olympic .
the man she married , william mckinley lewis , played football and competed in the sprints and the long jump for tuskegee .
both enjoyed athletics so much that they planned to make careers out of coaching and teaching physical education .
a hollywood writer dreaming up a birthplace for the person who would challenge jesse owens might place him in owen &apos;s home state of alabama .
carl lewis , in fact , was born in alabama , the third of the lewis &apos; four children .
at the age of two , carl went along with his family to willingboro , new jersey , where his parents had found jobs teaching and coaching for rival high schools .
bill and evelyn lewis cared so much about their favorite sport , track and field , that they used their own money to organize a track club in willingboro .
the four lewis children all benefited from their parents &apos; dedication to sports .
although they were never pushed into competing , they were influenced by their parents &apos; enthusiasm .
mackie , the oldest , was a sprinter who set a county record for the 220-yard dash .
cleve polished his skills in soccer so well that he became the first american black ever drafted by the pros and played two seasons with the memphis rogues .
carol , a year younger than carl , seemed to the best athlete of all .
blessed with a limitless supply of energy , she kept up with carl so well that her brother included her as one of his gang .
her excellent coordination and fearless nature combined to scare her parents half to death .
she and carl would try nearly any running , climbing , or jumping trick , regardless of the risk .
carl and carol hung closely together all through childhood .
when carl began taking cello lessons , carol started right in on the violin .
when their parents headed out to the track , carl and carol tagged along to play in the sand of the long-jump pit .
carl first became interested in jumping at age nine when his dad brought home a load of sand for a patio foundation .
in the minds of the lewis children , sand was for jumping , and they made their own long-jump pie out of the patio sand .
soon even the beach became their glorified long-jump pit .
carl and carol would carefully build sand castles and then back off and take running leaps to smash them .
hurdles , too , were a basic toy for the lewis family .
carl and carol would often set up a course of makeshift hurdles in their back yard .
one problem that arose , however , was that carl was not the athlete carol was .
small for his age , he frequently lost when racing his younger sister .
privately , bill and evelyn thought carl might be the non-athlete of the family .
for the most part , he could handle his defeats without bitterness .
but every so often , his resentment came to the surface .
&quot; i &apos;m tired of losing , &quot; he once complained to his dad .
he was told that he would just have to work harder at winning or else quit .
so carl continued to plug away at sports , especially long jumping .
long jumping doesn &apos;t normally attract many young children , and it was the unpopularity of the spot that appealed to carl .
instead of waiting his turn to practice with a mob of sprinters , carl could practice long jumping without having to take turns .
in a way , it was twice as fun as sprinting because a long jumper got to sprint and jump on the same turn .
only in the lewis family could a boy like carl have been considered a non-athlete .
by the end of the ninth grade , he was jumping 22 feet , a mark that few high school seniors can reach .
he was gaining that distance with his remarkable jumping form , however , not with outstanding speed or strength , and his times in the sprints and hurdles were nothing outstanding .
meanwhile , carl &apos;s refusal to listen to coaches made going much farther in sports doubtful .
nature then stepped in to change carl &apos;s life completely , and he started to gain the inches and muscles that he needed to improve his performances .
after sprouting nearly three inches during one year in high school , carl no longer lost races .
he owned a best time of 10.6 seconds in the 100-yard dash at the start of his junior year , and , with his new size and strength , immediately dropped that to an eye-catching 9.8 .
now carl wanted to concentrate on sprinting and drop the hurdles .
&quot; fine , &quot; said his coach . &quot; if you can get your 100 time down to 9.5 , you won &apos;t have to run any more hurdles . &quot;
by the end of the season , lewis had sped through a race in 9.3 !
in the long jump , however , carl ran into problems more serious than occasional squabbles with coaches .
while he was steadily improving his distances , he was just as steadily running his career .
carl &apos;s style of jumping high in the air put far too much strain on his leg .
while still in high school , his knees swelled up so badly that he bad to skip practices .
he could still get some remarkable jumps on those knees during meets , but there was a danger he could cause more serious damage to them .
true , he could set an american high school record of 26 feet , 8 inches , and he did finish third in the 1979 pan american games .
but would his legs last long enough for him to reach his tremendous potential ?
by now , lewis had made up his mind to try to zero in on the feats of those two track legends , beamon and owens .
as part of his plan , he enrolled at the university of houston .
there he would come under the guidance of tom tellez , one of track &apos;s most knowledgeable coaches .
the combination of a tough - minded coach and a notoriously independent athlete seemed dangerous , and some of carl &apos;s high school coaches might have expected that situation to explode .
tellez seemed to be asking for trouble when he told carl to scrap the jumping style he had spent years perfecting .
even the most coachable athletes often have trouble getting used to changing their routines , especially if they have been successful .
and lewis had turned his back on advice far less drastic than what tellez was suggesting .
all carl needed , however , was to be told why he should do something .
and tellez had the knowledge to explain why carl &apos;s leg wouldn &apos;t hold up to the strain of being slammed down at high speed .
the coach showed how carl &apos;s problem was made worse by his attempts to get high in the air on his jumps .
tellez insisted that speed was far more important than height in gaining distance .
since carl was an excellent sprinter , he had an advantage over other jumpers , and tellez said he should learn to use it .
the first step in improving lewis &apos; jumping was to have him stop jumping .
during his freshman year at huston , carl was told to work on his sprinting and leave long jumping alone .
only when his leg had fully healed was lewis allowed to practice and to try out tellez &apos; new jumping methods .
to get an idea of how hard it is for a trained athlete to start over with a new technique , imagine relearning to tie your shoes using only your thumbs and smallest fingers .
an athlete who was content with being one of the best would probably not bother trying to change .
but an athlete who was chasing legends as lewis lete who was chasing legends as lewis was would try almost anything to succeed .
as it turned out , there was a great deal more to carl lewis than just natural speed and spring .
he was also , in his coach &apos;s worlds , &quot; a physical genius . &quot;
all tellez had to do was to explain the mechanics of what needed to be done-such as how the arms and legs should be carried and what angle his takeoff should take - and carl was able to do it right the first time .
first , carl had to learn to practice only part of the long jump at a time .
his own injuries were proof of the surprising danger in what seemed to be a very simple exercise .
a world - class long jumper may reach a speed greater than 25 miles per hour during his approach , and even the most experienced long jumper feels . nervous when he plants his foot for the takeoff at that speed .
the impact can be brutal , as carl once showed when he sheared two metal spikes off his shoe during a jump !
some doctors worried that if lewis ever hit the takeoff board at his absolute top speed , the impact could destroy his leg .
for this reason , carl rarely took a full running jump in practice .
if he were to jump at all , he would take only a short run before jumping .
much of lewis &apos; practice time was spent in simply striding down the runway .
since all long jumps are measured from the end of the takeoff board , success depends on making sure the jumping foot always lands as near to the end of the board as possible .
for example , if a jumper takes off 10 inches behind the board , he or she must actually sail 27 feet and 10 inches in order to get credit for a 27- foot jump .
but if even a sliver of the foot touches beyond the board , a foul is declared , and the jump is not measured .
carl spent countless hours working on his stride so that even at high speed he could almost automatically jump at precisely the spot he wanted .
with the help of his coach , carl found the could work up to his best long-jumping speed in 2. strides .
time after time , he practiced speeding down the runway so that in those 23 strides he would travel exactly 168 feet .
later he changed to 171-foot run so he could use slightly longer strides .
another crucial part of long jumping is the takeoff angle .
floating high in the air like many long jumpers only slowed carl down and wasted his energy .
to avoid this , carl tried to keep his leap much closer to the ground than that of other jumpers .
the danger in doing that , however , was that the momentum of his speed would naturally tend to spin his body into a somersault while he was in the air .
the way to avoid flipping was to get the legs working against the spin during the jump .
and carl did this by developing his famous double-hitch kick .
when carl was in the air , he looked like he was pretending to ride a bicycle .
the 2.5 pedals that he went through in the air not only helped him keep his balance , they also brought his legs into proper position for a landing .
this double hitch had to be practiced constantly until it was done by instinct .
as carl noted , &quot; once you hit the board , it &apos;s so quick you can &apos;t remember it . &quot;
during his brief but wild 1.5 second trip through the air on a full-fledged long jump attempt , there would be no time to think about what he was supposed to be doing .
by the end of 1981 , carl had developed his skills so well that opponents were already starting to give up hope of beating him .
that season , he took his first step on the road to catching a legend when he became the first man since jesse owens to win a national competition in both a track event - running - and a field event-jumping and throwing .
while breaking into the top ranks of united states &apos; into the top ranks of united states &apos; 100-meter dash-men , lewis established himself as the finest long jumper in the country .
in the 1981 national collegiate athletic association championships , lewis was allowed to take nine long jumps .
although he decided to skip six of his nine attempts , he still ended up with the top three leaps in the competition !
carl and carol , who had followed her brother to the university of houston a year later , could have made their school the top track power in the country , but it never turned out that way .
although carl had been doing well in his studies as a communications major , he made the mistake of failing a history course .
for that error , he was declared ineligible to compete in his junior year .
miffed , lewis simply turned his back on the college athletic program .
although he continued to attend classes , lewis was through running for houston .
it was lewis &apos; good fortune good fortune to gain fame when the rules governing amateur athletes were relaxed to the point of being ridiculous .
there were all kinds of ways that an athlete could an amateur , a person who competes in sport for fun and not for profit .
when the word got out that carl lewis just might turn out to be one of the greatest trackmen of all time , many sponsors stepped forward to made deals with him .
as a result , carl could afford to live in an expensive house , hire tellez as his own private coach , and tellez as his own private coach , and still be eligible to compete in amateur track meets all over the country .
the more success lewis had , particularly in the long jump , the higher he set his goals .
when he announced that he was serious about going after bob beamon &apos;s mexico city record , a great debate started among track and field experts about whether he had any chance of doing it .
after all , wasn &apos;t that leap just a once-in-a-century fluke ?
even the best long jumpers in the world seemed to think so .
since that 1968 record , no one had some close to 29 feet , 2.5 inches .
in fact , they couldn &apos;t even reach 28 feet .
in all of his attempts following his miracle jump , beamon himself never topped 27 feet .
the facts seemed to show he had somehow done the impossible .
but carl and his coach didn &apos;t see it that way .
after proving himself as the united states &apos; best jumper and sprinter , lewis needed a bigger challenge .
deep inside himself , he felt he was born to do something truly extraordinary .
&quot; god &apos;s given me the talent ; i &apos;m just trying to be patient with it , &quot; he said .
breaking beamon &apos;s record would certainly be an extraordinary feat .
carl admitted he not only wanted to break it , he wanted to do it at sea level where the heavier air would make it more difficult .
and , if pressed further , he would confess that he thought there was a 30-foot jump inside of him , just waiting to come out .
it did not take long for carl to prove to a stunned track world that this was more than just idle talk .
on july 24 , 1982 , in indianapolis , indiana , he roared down the long-jump runway and struck the takeoff board as close to the end as was humanly possible .
there were gasps from the crowd as carl jetted over a seemingly unending stretch of carefully leveled sand .
just when it seemed he would crash out of the pit altogether , his legs finally came down near the back of the sand box .
but the crowd &apos;s excitement turned to a groan , and carl &apos;s look of triumph melted into anguish when an official signaled that he had fouled .
many observes hotly disputed the call and pointed out that carl had not disturbed the finely powdered substance spread just beyond the takeoff board to track any borderline fouls .
but the official &apos;s call stood , and , under the rules of track and field , the jump would not even be measured .
carl had to watch as the evidence of what was probably the longest jump in history-even longer than beamon &apos;s miracle leap of 1968-was raked away .
experts studying film of lewis &apos; indianapolis jump concluded that carl could have jumped 29.5 feet .
lewis himself thought he landed closer to 30 feet .
although that leap was never officially measured , it destroyed a myth about long jumping and showed that beamon really had not reached the upper limit of human athletic ability .
by breaking that mental barrier , carl gave long jumpers new goals to shoot for .
larry myricks , who had defeated carl in the 1980 olympic trials-one of the few long jumpers to defeat lewis-said carl &apos;s jump &quot; makes it easier for all of us to go farther . &quot;
instead of hoping to reach 27 feet in competition , myricks and other jumpers now started looking toward 28 feet .
for those skeptics who thought reports of carl &apos;s indianapolis jump were exaggerated , lewis displayed a rash of 28-foot jumps .
included among those was a best of 28 feet , 10.25 inches , which was within 5 inches of bob beamon &apos;s sacred ground .
for his pioneering efforts in the event , carl was named the 1982 athlete of the year by track and field news .
while he was still nipping at the heels of one legend , carl took off after the other .
he often thought of jesse owens and his historic trick of four track and field gold medals in a single olympics .
having mastered one of owen &apos;s events , the long jump , carl now turned his attention to the buckeye bullet &apos;s other specialty , the sprints .
as in long jumping , carl was willing to do whatever work was needed to make himself a successful sprinter , including scrapping his entire starting technique .
at 6 feet , 2 inches , carl was fairly tall for a sprinter , and tall sprinters generally do not have the quickness that smaller ones have in bursting out of the starting blocks .
lewis was even slower than most in getting into high gear .
in a race as short and quick as the 100-meter dash , a bad start could mean defeat for even the fastest sprinter .
carl worked hard on his coach &apos;s instructions to stay low to the ground as he drove out of his starting blocks .
once he had developed a respectable start , the rest was easy .
he only had to practice his sprinting form , which has been called the smoothest in history .
even his competitors marveled at how high he could lift his knees and how every muscle seemed to be under control .
in may 1983 , when he roared through the 100 meters at modesto , california , in 9.97 seconds-the fastest time ever recorded at sea level-carl served warning that world sprint records were no safer than long-jump marks .
it might have been tempting for lewis to stay with the 100 and the long jump and concentrate on breaking records .
but the legend of jesse owens and his four gold medals goaded him on to another event .
besides winning the long jump and 100-meter dash in 1936 , owens had also picked up first places in the 400-meter relay and the 200-yard dash .
the relay would be no problem for carl ; his part would be almost identical to running a 100-meter race .
that left the 200-meter dash as carl &apos;s final challenge .
if lewis &apos; dream of challenging owens &apos; mark had been a secret before , that secret was spilled in june 1983 when he added the 200 to his schedule of events at the track athletic championship meet .
carl had always run so effortlessly in the 100 that it seemed he might do well in the 200 .
the only questions were whether he could learn to sprint around a curve and if he had the endurance to finish strongly .
in just one race , carl answered all of those questions when he blazed to a united states &apos; record of 19.75 , just off the world record of 19.72 set by italy &apos;s pietro mennea .
only a foolish mistake by the inexperienced lewis kept him from setting his first outdoor world record .
ten yards before the finish line , a joyful lewis , realizing he would win the race , threw up his hands in joy .
veteran dashmen pointed out that his early celebration slowed him down and might have cost him a 10th of a second .
lee evans , the retired world record holder at 400 meters , told of how many races he had won in the last three or four meters .
he could not believe how often athletes would spoil years of preparation for a record by easing up before the end of a race .
in the same tac meet , carl also won the long jump and the 100-meter dash .
in doing so , he became the first united states &apos; athlete since 1886 to win the long sump and both sprints at a national championship meet .
now that he had proved it was possible to run well in all of those events at a single meet , all he needed to do before the 1984 olympics was to test his overseas competition .
the chance came later that summer in the world track and field championships at helsinki , finland .
there lewis discovered that his top competitors were all from the united states .
in helsinki , lewis led a u.s.a.sweep of the top three places in both the long jump and the 100 meters .
instead of taxing himself with the 200-meter run , he chose to anchor-that is , run the final leg of-the 400-meter relay . along with teammates emmitt king , willie gault , and calvin smith , lewis sped along to a world record of 37.86 .
by this time , carl &apos;s fame had spread beyond the pages of track magazines , and he was named male athlete of 1983 by the associated press .
while setting his sights on the 1984 olympics in los angeles , carl took time to make another effort at overhauling beamon &apos;s record .
in the millrose games at new york &apos;s madison square garden in january 1984 , carl was suffering through one of his worst outings ever .
in five weak jumps , the best he could manage was 27 feet , 2.75 inches .
seeing his chance to beat lewis at last , larry myricks flew 27 feet , 6 inches on his final try .
carl , however , had one more chance .
this time he catapulted through the air for 28 feet , 10.25 inches , which broke his own indoor long jump record by over 9 inches !
now it seemed just a matter of time before he would finally catch beamon .
as the olympics approached , lewis found the challenges on the track were easy compared to what he faced off the track .
carl was not a natural celebrity .
while his outgoing sister enjoyed the social scene , carl , a very private person , had always held back .
carol once said she was the one who always tested new situations in life and then , when she found out they were safe , she would bring carl along .
although carol could do some impressive feats of her own and was considered the united states &apos; best woman long jumper , it was carl who had to handle the publicity now .
as much as he wanted to , it was no longer possible to stay to himself and enjoy quiet hobbies such as collecting crystal .
he discovered just how little privacy he had when he received , among many pieces of fan mail , an overseas letter addressed only to &quot; carl lewis , u.s.a. &quot;
carl &apos;s business agent also made sure that his client &apos;s name stayed near the headlines .
it was he who declared that by the end of the olympics , lewis would be worth as much as multi-millionaire singer michael jackson !
such statements did not endear lewis to the public .
the idea of track athletes planning to turn their records and medals into million - dollar money-making schemes just did not fit the country &apos;s traditional idea of the modest , dedicated sports hero .
criticism , much of it cruel , came from all directions .
some writers even sneered at lewis &apos; ability and wondered when he didn &apos;t even own an individual outdoor world record .
the more that the press built lewis up as &quot; king carl &quot; and &quot; superman iv , &quot; the more people expected of him .
not many individuals can relax and have fun living up to a larger - than - life buildup , and it was impossible for a shy , private person such as carl .
while carl &apos;s agent planned to make him into a hot media star , carl was not acting like one .
he said he wanted to be known only as someone who was a nice guy and did his job in his own way .
unfortunately for carl , there was no way he could do things his own way and he considered a nice guy .
on the track , lewis often kept to himself when other athletes thought he should be more outgoing .
but it was his actions at the end of a race of disturbed competitors even more .
besides costing him a world record , his habit of raising his arms in triumph before he hit the finish line seemed like hotdogging to some .
so did his smiles of joy when he sometimes looked around to see how far behind his opponents were during the last meters of a race .
those actions brought stinging criticism from the highly respected hurdler edwin moses who thought carl was rubbing it in and not showing respect for his opponents .
lewis &apos; chief rival in the long jump , larry myricks , confessed that his relationship with carl was not the friendliest and that there would be some &quot; serious celebrating &quot; when carl got beat .
lewis argued that he wasn &apos;t intending to show off or belittle anyone .
when he was happy , he couldn &apos;t help but show it .
but his competitors were not convinced by his arguments , and carl had to live with the criticism of not acting like a hero should .
carl shrugged off all the controversy as best he could and geared up for the great olympic challenge .
while many of the 1984 olympic events were hurt by the absence of the boycotting athletes from the soviet union and their allies , everyone admitted that the missing countries would have no effect on carl &apos;s quest to match owen &apos;s four gold medals .
none of the eastern bloc countries had an athlete who could come close to challenging for a gold medal in carl &apos;s events .
as the experts pointed out , the stiffest test on the way to the four golds would come well before the olympics .
to win a spot on the olympic team in each of his events , lewis would be going against the strongest sprinters and jumpers in the world , the united states &apos; athletes .
by far the largest obstacle in carl &apos;s way was the 100 -meter dash at the united states &apos; trials in los angeles in june 1984 .
the final race of the trials would possibly be the greatest collection of sprinters ever put together in one race and far more competitive than the olympic final .
to get a chance to compete in the olympic 100 , carl needed to finish in the top three . one tiny lapse could ruin his chance .
carl must have been thinking hard about the race because when he prepared to run one of the preliminary heats of the 100 , he found he had not put on his shorts under his sweat pants !
after ducking into a stadium tunnel to slip on the shorts , carl earned a spot in the finals .
he had to wait while a friend nervously rushed to find carl &apos;s uniform and get it to him in time .
the man had to wave from the stands to attract lewis &apos; attention when security officers refused to allow him onto the field .
carl drew lane two for the finals .
as he settled into his starting blocks , he was aware of the danger his dream was in .
calvin smith , owner of the world record in this event-a 9.93 recorded at high altitude-was to his left in lane one .
brushing carl &apos;s right shoulder was emmit king , a member of the world-record 400-meter relay team and the 1983 ncaa 100 - meter champ .
the massive shoulders of ron brown filled lane four .
brown had passed up a rich pro football contract with the los angeles rams for a chance to run in the olympics .
lane five belonged to mel lattany , whose best time of 9.96 topped anything carl had ever done .
harvey glance , veteran of the 1976 olympics , crouched in lane six .
the last two lanes were given to the ncaa &apos;s most recent champions .
kirk baptiste , the college 200-meter king , seemed to be improving with every race .
sam graddy , the ncaa 100-meter-champ , was out in lane eight , where he could sneak past lewis without carl ever seeing him .
only three of these eight record-holding sprinters would qualify for the olympic 100 .
at the crack of the gun , eight pairs of legs churned into action .
carl started well and stayed in the middle of the tightly -packed wall of runners .
gradually , he pulled away from the field , clocking a 10.06 time running into a wind .
graddy finished second , and brown edged the rest for third place .
the competition had been so fierce that the world record holder , calvin smith , did not qualify for the olympic 100 .
carl &apos;s first place finish automatically gave him a spot on the 400-meter relay team , and he had no problem in qualifying for the 200-meter dash or the long jump .
if he could stand up to the pressure of the olympics and the grueling series of preliminary heats , lewis was almost certain to gain the heights that only jesse owens had reached .
in 1936 , 22-year-old jesse owens had entered hostile territory .
the olympics were being held in berlin , germany , under the watchful eye of nazi dictator adolph hitler .
the games were to be a showcase for the nazi claim that the european ace was far superior to any other people in the world .
but it was a black athlete , owens , who dominated the events .
jesse had taken advantage of teammate ralph metcalf s slow start to sprint to victory in the 100-meter dash .
metcalf finished second to owen &apos;s world-record-tying 10.2 in the long jump , jesse could easily have been unnerved by a misunderstanding .
he simply ran through the pit on his warm up only to learn that the competition had actually begun .
when that attempt was declared a foul , owens started pulled himself together for a leap of 26 feet , 5 inches .
not only did that win the gold medal , it also stood as a world record for 25 years !
after that , owens had breezed to victory with an olympic record in the 200 meters and a world record in the 200 meters and a world record in the 400-meter relay .
it was carl lewis &apos; job to match that incredible speed and athletic talent .
just as it had been in the olympic trials , the 100-yard dash would be carl &apos;s most difficult challenge .
it is difficult to relax when an instant &apos;s hesitation can drop a runner from first too last , but carl knew that the key to winning the race was in relaxing so his body could run smoothly .
after routinely working his way to the finals , carl stared down the track to his first gold medal , 100 meters away .
this time , he had drawn lane seven , two lanes away from sam graddy , his most dangerous medal threat .
graddy , settling into lane five , seemed hot-wired for quick starts .
he was fast enough so that lewis could not afford to let him get too much of a lead .
as if to show his critics that he was still going to do things his way , carl had come to olympics wearing his hair in a very distinctive , square , brush cut .
he didn &apos;t need a special haircut to attract attention , however , as everyone in the stadium was watching carl lewis .
at the starter &apos;s signal , the sprinters reared up for the start .
when the gun sounded sam graddy shot out of the blocks with the suddenness of a gust of wind shattering a pane of glass .
carl got off to a decent start.bit out was taking him some time to reach the speed of the shorter graddy .
at the halfway point , he was still no better than third .
to inexperienced spectators , it looked as if carl would lose .
but while other runners had reached top speed and were trying to hold it for the last 50 meters , lewis was still accelerating .
graddy fought furiously to hold his lead and thought he night have a chance to win when carl still had not caught him at 80 meters .
but then came the optical illusion . lewis shot by so quickly that it seemed he had reserved an extra kick for the end .
actually , he had just maintained the tremendous speed he had finally built up to while the other sprinters had begun to slow slightly .
carl finished to strongly that his time of 9.99 was.2 of a second faster than the second-place graddy , who had held off canada &apos;s ben johnson for the silver medal .
in a 100-meter trace , .2 of a second is a decisive margin of defeat .
it was not the usual lewis expression of joy that fans saw at the end of the race . carl looked more like an outlaw who had just escaped from a close brush with a posse .
he seemed just plain relieved that the event was over .
lewis put in his toughest day of olympic work on august 6 , 1984 .
as he prepared for the long-jump finals that evening , he was starting to feel the effects of all the activity that day .
he had already run two heats of the 200-meter dash , a tiring race for him , in order to qualify for the semifinals .
he had also done the preliminary long jumps that had qualified him for the final .
coach tellez had been worried about this day .
knowing how much long jumping saps an athlete &apos;s legs , he knew that carl needed to qualify on his first jumps to ease the strain on his legs .
fortunately , carl had done that .
now a packed crowd was looking for carl to shift his sights away from jesse owens and on to bob beamon &apos;s record .
little did they know a tricky swirling wind and the hurried pace of carl &apos;s day would make hits effort futile .
nevertheless , lewis sped down the runway to give it his best shot .
hitting his takeoff spot well , he soared 28 feet , 0.25 inch , the second-longest jump in olympic history .
in that one brief instant , the long-jump competition was over .
carl tried a second jump but stepped over the end of the board for a foul .
he would be allowed four more jumps .
but when he pulled on his sweat pants , he decided that he was probably through for the night .
his leg had felt a little sore after his second jump , and the remembered his coach &apos;s warning about how taxing a single jump could be .
as he saw the competition falling far short of his mark , he realized that conditions were far from ideal for breaking the record .
so knowing that he had probably clinched first place with his first jump , he passed his final attempts in order to save himself for the events that remained .
when the crowd realized what carl was doing , they began booing him .
they felt they had paid good money to see him at least try to reach beamon &apos;s mark , but they had misjudged carl &apos;s personality .
they had come to see carl personality . they had come to see carl lewis , the entertainer .
but despite carl &apos;s position as a star , he wasn &apos;t an entertainer .
lewis was an athlete , and he was after only one thing : four gold medals .
if there were world records to be set , he would deal with them later .
as it turned out , only one other jumper came within a foot of carl &apos;s first jump .
now it was two gold medals down and two to go .
lewis cruised through his semifinal heat of the 200-meter dash in an excellent time of 20.27 .
based on the few times he had run the event , the 200 seemed to be carl &apos;s best race .
among track experts , the only suspense in the race was whether or not he would break the world record .
in the 200-meter dash , runners begin by running on a curve of the track and then finish on a straight-away .
carl had been having some trouble getting a smooth , relaxed stride on the curve portion of the race , and he wanted to master that problem in the finals .
as the bent down into his starting blocks , he made up his mind to do the best curve-running of his life .
another united states &apos; runner , thomas jefferson , got the best start in the race , but lewis quickly passed him .
charging around the curve as he had never done before , carl had already stretched out to a comfortable lead when he reached the straight-away .
since carl &apos;s finish had always been the best part of his race , it start had nearly been a fatal mistake , and carl was glad he had not spent any more of his energy back at the long-jump pit .
it would have been better show business if carl had been pushed by tough competition when he tried to win the medal that would link him forever with jesse owens .
but everyone knew the 400-meter relay was going to be a breeze for the u.s.team.
after all , it was almost certain that four of the five fastest men in the race would be running for the u.s.a.
even if they had sloppy baton exchanges , carl and his teammates would still win .
only a dropped baton could beat them .
from his spot on the far curve of the track , lewis watched his team-maters carry his gold medal hopes in their hands . while there hopes in their hands .
while there wasn &apos;t a chance of them being outsprinted , his medal wouldn &apos;t be safe until he could feel the baton firmly in he could feel the baton firmly in his fingers .
sam graddy led off and raced around the first curve toward ron brown .
brown then pounded down the backstretch and handed off to calvin smith .
as he zeroed in on lewis , smith opened up a large lead .
none of the handoffs were perfect , and lewis made the risky move of switching the baton from one hand to the other during his run . but the exchanges do their work .
carl lewis flew across the finish line in a time of 37.83 .
the four gold medals were now his , and it was especially satisfying to cap his pursuit of the jesse owen &apos;s legend with a world - record time in the relay .
after such a stunning achievement , one might have expected lewis to retire from competition .
instead , carl set his sights on the 1988 olympics .
there , carl would attempt an extraordinary feat - to repeat his four gold medals performance of 1984 .
carl &apos;s dream ended abruptly in the 100-meter dash .
canada &apos;s ben johnson exploded out of the blocks and finished first in an astounding 9.79 second .
but carl took the gold in the long jump with his 56 th win in a row in that event .
the next day , international olympic committee officials announced that illegal steroids had been found in ben johnson &apos;s post-race drug test .
johnson &apos;s gold medal was stripped from him and given to second-place lewis .
suddenly , the dream of four gold medals flickered anew .
but lewis finished second in the 200-meter dash .
and the u.s.400-meter relay team botched a baton pass in the semifinals and was disqualified .
carl had failed to repeat his 1984 olympic performance , but no athlete could feel disappointed about winning two gold medals and one silver in any olympic games .
and carl had actually improved on his 1984 olympic marks in all three events .
bob beamon &apos;s longstanding record in the long jump of 29 feet , 2.5 inches was broken finally in 1991-but not by carl lewis .
at the world track and field championships in tokyo on august 30 , 1991 , lewis top score of the day was an impressive 29 feet , 1.25 inches against the wind .
although this jump was the best carl had ever made in competition up to that point , it was not good enough to break the new world record set that day by fellow american mike powell .
powell had jumped 29 feet , 4.25 inches .
in spite of this obvious disappointment , lewis was enthusiastic about his performance at the world championships .
he had set a new world record in the 100 meters at 9.86 seconds five days before the long jump competition and participated in the record-breaking win of the u.s.team in the 400-meter relay with a time of 37.5seconds.
in this own words , &quot; greatest meet i never had . &quot;
what &apos;s ahead for carl lewis , now that the old long jump record has been broken ?
with his self-confidence and determination still intact , he confided to a reporter , &quot; for 10 years , 29 feet has been my goal .
so now it &apos;s nine meters . &quot;
this talented athlete is still chasing legends-and is well on his way to becoming a legend himself !
formal athletics events include two groups : track and field .
the track events are those that require speed against other athletes , while in the field events the athletes compete at a time in jumping or throwing trials .
events on the track can be divided into several sections .
on the flat , there are sprints , middle distance races and long distance races . there are also the four by one hundred meters relay and the four by four hundred meters relay .
in addition , races are run over hurdles and barriers from one hundred and ten meters up to three thousand meters .
extreme distance races include the marathon over forty-two kilometers and the men &apos;s fifty kilometers road walk .
events in the field can be divided into two sections : jumping and throwing .
jumping events include the high jump , lone jump , triple jump and pole vault .
throwing events comprise the javelin , discus , hammer and shot put .
whereas track races are measured by time , accurate to one hundredth of a second , field events are measured by distance or height in meters .
every athlete is allowed three attempts to achieve a qualifying distance or height . if he is successful , he progresses to the next round .
olympic hurdle events are the 110m , the 400m , and the 3,000m steeplechase . the steeplechase consists of hurdles and water jumps ; the hurdles for this event are more robust than the others . and the runners can either step onto them or jump them .
the race walks generally take place on roads rather than on the formal track .
the main characteristic of walking is that the runner &apos;s front foot must touch the ground before he lifts his rear foot .
olympic race walks are the 20km and 50km for men and 10km for women .
the decathlon is a 2-day contest for men , and comprises 100m , long jump , high jump , shot , 400m , 110m hurdles , discus , pole vault , javelin and 1,500m .
the heptathlon is a contest for women , and consists of 100m , 100m hurdles , shot , javelin , high jump , long jump , and 800m .
&quot; can sit-ups help reduce the bulge in my stomach . &quot;
&quot; my friends say that sit-ups work . is this true ? &quot;
no .
they will strengthen the muscles underneath the fat but you won &apos;t lose any more fat there than you will on the rest of your body .
if you want to lose a significant amount of fat , the best way is through aerobic exercise such as running , biking and swimming , which will help you burn off fat all over the body , including the stomach .
the english are passionate lovers of competitive sports ; and when they are neither playing nor watching games they like to talk about them , or when they cannot do that , to think about them .
the game peculiarly associated with england is cricket .
many other games too are english in origin , but have been popularly adopted in other countries ; but cricket has been extensively adopted only in the commonwealth , particularly in australia , india , pakistan and the west indies .
nearly every village in england , except in far north , has its cricket club .
a first-class match lasts for up to three days , with six hours &apos; play on each afternoon .
cricket makes no progress in popularity .
for the majority of the british public the eight months of the football season are more important than the four months of cricket .
professional football is always a big business . every town has at least one professional football club . every town has at least one professional football club .
the players have not necessarily any personal connection with the town for whose team they play . they are bought and sold between the clubs .
the cup final , which is played in may each year in london , is the greatest event of the season .
rugby football is played with an egg-shaped ball . it can be a dangerous game as players wear no protective clothing .
this form of sport got its name because it originated from the famous rugby public school .
there is some professional league rugby in the north , but elsewhere rugby union is mainly played by amateurs and favored by the middle class .
it is also the game played at the great majority of &quot; public schools &quot; .
most secondary schools have playing fields , and boys usually play rugger or soccer in winter and cricket in summer as a normal school activity ; while schoolgirls play tennis and a sort of baseball in summer and netball and hockey in winter .
men &apos;s basketball is almost unknown .
the more social adult games of golf and tennis are played by great numbers of people .
golf courses are also meeting places of the business community . it is , for example , very desirable for bank managers to play golf .
moreover , there are plenty of tennis clubs . every town provides numerous tennis courts in public parks , and anyone can play tennis cheaply .
next to association football , the chief spectator sport in english life is horse racing .
partly because of the laws which forbid such activities on sundays , horse racing is organized rather differently in england from other countries .
their horse racing mainly takes place on working days and during working hours .
the whole atmosphere of a race meeting still belongs in some ways to the eighteenth century with old divisions between upper and lower people .
every day people all over the country bet on the day &apos;s races .
although the british are so fond of watching horses racing , they are not very interested in being spectators at occasions when human beings race together .
although athletic sports and gymnastics are practiced at school , few towns have running tracks for public use .
remarkably few people are interested in bicycle racing .
on the other hand , rowing , in fours or eights , occupies a leading place in the sporting life of schools and universities which have suitable water near by . it is watched from the river banks by vast crowds of spectators .
when english people use the word &quot; hunting &quot; they usually mean fox-hunting , a sport which is popular among a small but important minority .
there are many people who would like to see fox-hunting forbidden by law on the ground that it is cruel , but there is little possibility that this will be done .
americans use the word &quot; hunting &quot; to include the shooting of birds , but the english do not .
the moorlands of the north and of scotland are rich in grouse and partridge . and to go shooting on the moors is perhaps the most distinctive of upper-class activities .
the opening of shooting season on august 12th attracts many top people on the moors . they pay enormous amounts for their pleasure .
being afraid of losing votes , modern leaders do not shoot , or if they do they try their best to avoid the photographers .
britain was the first home of many of the modern world &apos;s most popular sports .
the english can not claim , today , that they have surpassing skill in any form of sport when they engage in international competition . but they care strongly about the &quot; sporting spirit &quot; , the capacity to play with respect for the rules and the opponents , to win with modesty and to lose with good temper .
a love of sport has been characteristic in highlands and lowlands alike . it is inherent in the scottish character .
of all the games played in scotland in days gone by , three stand out as claiming scottish origin and being particularly scottish in character - golf , curling , and shinty , and of these golf has now achieved world-wide popularity .
the best country for golf is a large expanse of uncultivated soil not too much broken up by hills ; and in scotland the links , particularly along the east coast , form ideal ground .
of all scottish golfing centers , st. andrews is the shrine of golfing tradition .
there is much evidence , however , that the kings and queens of scotland themselves shared their people &apos;s enthusiasm for playing games .
mary queen of scots was accused by her enemies of playing golf shortly after her husbands &apos; murder .
and the years before 1857 have been described as the golden age of private golf matches , for it saw the first championships inaugurated at the initiative of the prestwick golf club in scotland . it began with a letter addressed by the prestwick golf club to seven leading clubs , proposing that each club should nominate four players for a golf match . the last victorious pair should be declared champions and the prize be a medal or a piece of plate .
the response was enthusiastic . this began the english amateur golf championship , now restricted to players born in england the channel island and the sons of parents born in these places .
curling is a game played on a sheet of ice .
this sport is believed to have sprung from holland just over four centuries ago , but scotland has been its real home since the early part of the seventeenth century .
in principle the game very much resembles bowls , but curling is played with heavy flat stones to slide along the ice .
the oldest curling stone found in scotland bears the date of 1511 .
the game is often referred to as &quot; the roaring game &quot; because of the sound resulting from the stone speeding along .
like golf , curling can claim to be both royal ancient .
tradition has it that the stuart kings were curlers , and both mary queen of scots and darnley are reputed to have played .
like golf , it too has won popularity outside scotland , although to lesser extent , and there are curling clubs in england , canada , new zealand , russia and switzerland .
now curling stones are cut from hard rock , rounded and polished , and fitted with a wooden handle .
among games less widely popular , but still played with great enthusiasm , shinty is one of the most traditional .
played with a ball made of cork and leather and a wooden club , it used to be popular amongst all ages , particularly round about the season of christmas , but now is usually indulged in only by the more youthful members of the community .
in the old days it was the custom for local parishes to engage each other in this game , and the prize , according to one tradition a keg of &quot; genuine mountain dew , &quot; was attractive , for highland whisky was appreciated no less than today .
shinty is a fine free game , much less restricted by rules but otherwise not unlike hockey which is derived from it .
in old times a field of shinty must have resembled a battleground ; its usual accompaniment being skirling pipes and waving banners .
today the pipes still play a picturesque part , marching their teams on to the field of play and hailing their victories with piercing blasts of triumph .
in relation to population , australia holds an outstanding international position in sport . its champions have been many and varied , and there is hardly a popular sport in which australia has not gained recognition .
most likely explanation for this sporting preeminence seems to lie not in any single reason , but in a combination of factors .
natural ability is an important consideration , as is the opportunity that potential champions have to develop in their particular fields through widespread clubs , state and national competitions .
many australian youngsters of both sexes begin playing regular competitive sports at the early age of eight or under . thousands of youngsters can be seen each weekend joining in football , cricket , tennis , hockey , basketball and swimming competitions .
sport also plays an important part in school life , where a half-day a week is usually set aside for inter-school competitions . spectator sports like horse-racing , football , cricket , tennis and car-racing draw big crowds .
and public interest in stimulated by extensive television , newspaper and radio coverages .
a distinctively australian contribution is the volunteer surf-lifesaving movement which keeps a constant vigil over swimmers in the surf .
thousands of young men , all excellent swimmers , belong to these clubs at most surfing beaches .
the spectacular surf carnivals when the lifesavers compete against each other in special surf events are an outstanding feature of the australian summer scene .
other popular water sports are swimming in constructed pools and inland waters , yachting and sailing , surfboard riding , water-skiing , skin-diving , motor-boat racing and fishing , including big-game , beach and rock fishing and freshwater angling .
in winter , snow sports in the australian alps have become popular , and facilities in the snowfields have developed rapidly in recent years to keep pace with increasing demand .
growing numbers of top overseas skiers and instructors are coming to the australian snow resorts during the northern hemisphere summer .
there are four main codes of football .
australian rules , a fast , open and rugged game , played with 18 men a side on a large oval field , is the chief code in four of the six states .
rugby league and rugby union are the most popular codes in new south wales and queensland , while soccer is played in all states , mainly by migrants , and is growing in popularity .
other popular sports include men &apos;s and women &apos;s field hockey , basketball , squash and athletics .
there are also many devotees of baseball and softball , table tennis and rifle-shooting , boxing , wrestling , judo , archery , rowing , fencing , gymnastics , ten-pin bowling .
all forms of horse-riding are popular , from pony clubs to polo and olympic equestrian style events .
the premier turf event is the melbourne cup , held at flemington racecourse in november . it is a public holiday in the melbourne metropolitan area and the focus of national betting interest .
the olympic games are the oldest international amateur sporting contest in the world . held every four years , the games supposedly developed from ancient greek athletic contests in honor of a god or dead hero .
the original sole event was a 210-yard race held in 776 bc in olympia in honor of zeus . later additional events such as boxing , wrestling , long jumping , discus and javelin throwing , distance running and chariot racing were added .
the games at olympia lasted seven days .
the games lost popularity , however , largely due to the growth of cheating and were abolished by emperor theodosius i in 394 ad .
in 1896 the first modern olympic games were held in athens , organized by a frenchman , pierre de coubertin .
since then the games have been held in different cities once every four years except in 1916 , 1940 and 19044 .
in 1924 the winter olympics were started at chamois , france .
there is no age limit for competitors , unless one has been established by a sport &apos;s international federation . no discrimination is allowed on grounds of race , religion , or political affiliation .
the games are contests between individuals and not between countries .
in 1986 the ioc voted to alternate the summer and winter games every two years , beginning in 1994 .
the winter games would be held in 1992 and again in 1994 and thereafter would be held every four years ; the summer games would maintain their original four year cycle .
the maximum numbers of entries permitted for in dividable events is three per nation . the number is fixed by the ioc in consultation with the international federation concerned .
in team events , only one team per country is allowed .
the ioc is the supreme authority responsible for policy making regarding the olympic movement and the spread of modem olympics .
it was founded in 1894 by pierre de coubertin .
the ioc recognizes one national olympic committee for each country .
lausanne was chosen as the site for the ioc headquarters in 1913 .
members of the executive board sit for four-year terns . the president is elected for eight years and is expected to serve as the leading spokesman for the olympic movement .
seven men have held this post .
the form of the opening ceremony is laid down by the ioc in great detail , from the moment when the chief of state of the host country is received by the president of the ioc and the organizing committee at the entrance to the stadium , to the end of the proceedings when the last team files out .
when the head of state has reached his place in the tribune , he is greeted with the national anthem of his country , and the parade of competitors begins .
the greek team is always the first to enter the stadium , and , except for the host team , which is always last , the other nations follow in alphabetical order as determined by the language of the organizing country .
each contingent , dressed in its official uniform , is preceded by a shield with the name of its country , while an athlete carries its national flag .
the competitors march around the stadium and then form up in the center of the ground facing the tribune .
the president of the organizing committee then delivers a brief speech of welcome , followed by another brief speech from the president of the ioc , who asks the chief of state to proclaim the games open .
the olympic hymn is sounded as the olympic flag is slowly raised ; pigeons are released , symbolically to fly to the countries of the world with the news that the games are open .
the olympic flame is then carried into the stadium by the last of the runners who have brought it from olympia , greece . the runner circles the track , mounts the steps , and lights the olympic fire that burns night and day during the games .
the closing ceremony takes place after the final event .
since the melbourne olympics in 1956 , and after certain formalities have been observed , the athletes taking part stage of their own demonstrations .
the ceremonies include a parade of athletes , six from each nation , marching eight or 10 abreast without distinction of nationality , signifying the friendly bonds of olympic sport .
the president of the ioc calls the youth of the world to assemble in four years to celebrate the games of the next olympiad .
a fanfare is sounded , the olympic fire is extinguished , and to the strains of the olympic hymn the olympic flag is lowered and the games are over .
in the stadium and its immediate surroundings , the olympic flag is flown freely together with the flags of the nations taking part .
the olympic flag presented by baron coubertin in 1914 is the prototype : it has a white background and in the center there are five interlaced rings blue , yellow , black , green and red . the blue ring is on the left next to the pole .
these rings represent the five continents joined together in the olympic movement .
the olympic hymn plays as the flag of the ioc is raised . the music was composed by spirou samara . the words were added by costs palmas , 1896 , greece .
&quot; citrus , altus , forties . &quot; latin meaning &quot; faster , higher , braver . &quot; the modern version is &quot; swifter , higher , stronger . &quot;
the motto was coined by father did on , a french educator , in 1895 .
&quot; the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part , just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well . &quot;
an athlete of the host country recites the following at the opening ceremony . &quot; in the name of all competitors i promise that we will take part in these olympic games , respecting and abiding by the rules which govern them , in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams . &quot;
both the oath and the creed were composed by pierre de coubertin , founder of the modem games .
the flame symbolizes the continuity between the ancient and modern games .
the modern version of the flame was adopted in 1936 .
the torch used to kindle the flame was first lit by the sun &apos;s rays at olympia , greece , and then carried to the site of the games by relays of runners .
now ships and planes are used when necessary .
an official summer olympic program must include at least 15 of the following sports : archery , athletics , basketball , boxing , canoeing , cycling , diving , equestrian sports , fencing , field hockey , football , gymnastics , handball , judo , modern pentathlon , rowing , shooting , swimming , table tennis , tennis , volleyball , water polo , weight lifting , wrestling , and yachting .
an olympic program may also include up to two demonstration sports and in addition must include national exhibitions and demonstration of fine arts .
the olympic village was first introduced at los angeles in 1932 . the organizing committee provides the village so that competitors and team officials can be housed together and fed at a reasonable price .
the villages are located as close as possible to the main stadium and other facilities and have separate accommodations for men and women , only competitors and officials may live in the village , and the number of team officials is limited .
the honor of holding the olympic games is entrusted to a city and not to a country .
the choice of the city lies solely with the ioc .
application to hold the games is made by the chief authority of the city , with the support of the national government .
applications must state that no political meetings or demonstrations will be held in the stadium or other sports grounds or in the olympic village , and it must be promised that every competitor shall be given free entry without any discrimination on grounds of religion , color , or political affiliation , this involves the assurance that the national government will not refuse visas to any of the competitors .
another form of oriental martial arts is tai chi chuan .
tai chi , is a system of slow-moving exercises , mostly practiced to enhance health , relaxation and mental poise .
only a limited number of masters of the art understand the principles of tai chi enough to be able to use it for combat .
tai chi emphasises a balance or harmony between two opposing forces-yin and yang .
according to the principles of tai chi , destruction or imbalance occurs when one of the two forces becomes predominant .
tai chi aims at bringing these extremes closer together in order to achieve a harmony.the main objective is to maintain muscular and nervous relaxation while the body is in movement .
and for this reason , tai chi is often referred to as &apos; meditation in movement &apos; !
martial arts encourage the cultivation of total awareness , not only of yourself , but also of your surroundings a state of being that is supposed to enhance and calm the mind .
martial arts are more than just physical exercise they also help to relax the mind and counter the physical and psychological pressures of modern living .
there are many different forms of martial arts , or kung-fu as it &apos;s known , they are practiced throughout the world , the most popular of which are probably karate and tai chi .
kung-fu literally means a man who works with art .
there are various theories concerning the origins of kung-fu and scholars have noted its existence for more than 5,000 years .
kung-fu also has many different styles , of which animal styles are the most predominant .
as an exercise , kung-fu encourages health and longevity .
it trains and improves the speed and power not only of the body , but also of the mind .
the history of karate can be traced back through the centuries to a few hundred years bc .
today , this fighting art has evolved into a sport which is enthusiastically pursued by millions around the world .
karate is much more than just a form of physical discipline . it is also a mental discipline from which you can draw strength to apply to everyday life .
karate is basically a punching and kicking form of martial arts .
it exercises every inch of the body and its muscles .
it also trains you to think the karate way , which is tough but tolerant .
water polo was once seen as underwater soccer .
today it is considered to be one of the fastest , most skilled , and most exhilarating of team games .
it is played by two teams of up to 11 a side , only seven of whom may be in the water at the same time .
the ball may be propelled one-handed , but not punched by any player other than the goalkeeper .
each team attempts to score by putting the ball into its opponent &apos;s goal .
the game is played in a pool at least 1.8 meters deep .
a game consists of four seven-minute periods .
the pool is thirty meters long and twenty meters wide . the pool is divided at the centre by a half distance line . at each end of the pool there is a goal three meters wide , painted white , and on a floating platform . in front of the goal is a two meters offside line and a four meters line .
the ball must be round , smooth and waterproof .
water polo was devised in england in about 1870 .
it was called polo because originally the players rode floating barrels , painted to look like horses , and they hit the ball with sticks .
water polo was included in the olympics in paris in 1900 .
nowadays water polo is included as an event in most major swimming competitions .
swimming is the action of supporting your body in water and propelling it forward by the movement of the arms and legs .
it is a recreation practiced in the sea or in indoor and outdoor swimming pools for today &apos;s people .
no one knows where and when the first swimming competition was held .
modern competitive swimming began in britain in the 19th century .
by 1908 , a world governing body , the federation international de notation amateur was formed .
the federation laid down international rules and created a world record list .
these rules applied to the olympic swimming events , which opened to men from 1896 and to women from 1912 .
today swimming is the second most important event in the olympic games .
competitions are held in a 50m pool . the short-course swimming , which has become popular in recent years , is held in a 25m pool .
there are two olympic events for canoeing competitions . kayaks and canadian canoes .
canoe races are normally held on flat water 1- , 2- , and 4- man or women teams over distances of 500 , 1,000 , and 10,000 meters for men and 500 meters for women .
the winner is determined solely by time .
north american indians and eskimos on greenland were the first people to build canoes .
flat water canoeing was first included in the olympics at berlin in 1936 .
slalom canoeing was introduced to the olympics at munich in 1972 .
rowing is the sport of propelling a boat by means of oars operated by hand .
in racing each member of the rowing team , or crew , uses both hands-to pull oar through the water .
the boat , or shell , is sometimes steered by a coxswain , who also directs the speed and rhythm of the crew &apos;s strokes .
sculling is a variant of rowing in which each oarsman controls two oars , one in each hand .
rowing crews have two , four , or eight members , with or without a coxswain .
international rowing has been organized since 1892 under the control of the federation internationale des societies d &apos;aviron .
rowing was officially recognized as an olympic sport in london in 1908 .
the first fisa world rowing championships were held in 1962 .
fisa junior championships started in 1970 .
women &apos;s rowing events were included in the olympics for the first time at montreal in 1976 .
diving is a competitive individual sport in which the diver projects himself into the air from a high board or springboard . the diver may plunge straight into the water or may perform difficult mid-air gymnastic man oeuvres ending with a clear and graceful entry into the water .
competitive diving is divided into men &apos;s and women &apos;s springboard and high board events .
springboards are 1m or 3m high , and high board diving platforms are 5m or 10m high , competitors perform a set number of compulsory and voluntary dives , each of which is marked .
a competition is won by the competitor with most marks .
springboard diving was first included in the olympics at st. louis in 1904 . platform diving was included in the supplementary olympics at athens in 1906 .
in 1912 at stockholm , women divers first took part in the olympics .

articles from local newspapers are in this folder and articles from out-of-state newspapers are in this one .
the third folder contains a few related magazine clippings .
would you like me to get a copy of the sears account ?
i &apos;ll prepare a list of sales figures for that month and attach a summary of the invoices .
i &apos;ll look their phone numbers up and bring them to you as soon as possible .
do you need their addresses too ?
i will check on the availability of the conference room for that day and if that time slot is open . i will reserve it .
would you like any audio-visual equipment present ?
will you need a microphone and speakers , overhead , slide or movie projector , or cassette tape deck ?
would you like a lectern for the presentation ?
i will arrange for an interpreter to be present .
folios will be prepared for each attendee and left by their namecards on the conference table .
what time would you like refreshments served ?
travel arrangements and lodging for your trip have been confirmed . i left a schedule and tickets on your desk this morning .
i &apos;ve already called for a taxi to pick you up at the entrance . it should be here in ten minutes or so . the guard will call when it arrives .
is there anything else you need done in the meantime ?
i &apos;m afraid we are out of b-4 size copy paper .
shall i order some ?
mr. youshida will give an address during today &apos;s morning assembly . may i start my work on the telefax machine after that ?
you received a call from mr. jackson an hour ago , but the said it wasn &apos;t urgent . there &apos;s memo on your desk .
i &apos;ve cleared your desk and arranged this afternoon &apos;s reports for you to examine .
i &apos;m scheduled to use the word processor from 9 : 30 to 11 : 00 , so if it &apos;s alright with you , i &apos;ll type the report right after i finish .
i think i &apos;ll be able to finish it before lunch .
i &apos;d better file those invoices before something happens to them .
if you don &apos;t need me for anything else , i &apos;ll take care of them now .
the director would like to see you as soon as you are free .
the first thing you have to do in the morning is to place mr. williams telephone messages and today &apos;s newspaper on his desk .
the other employees take their lunch break at noon , but you will have to stay here and receive calls until 12 : 30 , when ms. gates returns .
then you can go to lunch until 1 : 30 .
if mr. williams needs any information from the computer , you will have priority on this terminal .
you will have to read these computer manuals sometime this week and he will assign you a user number and password to log on with .
prepare pots of hot coffee for visitors at all times .
it is your responsibility to greet them and serve them while they are waiting for mr. williams .
outgoing and incoming correspondence is kept in this file , invoices and receipts in this one , and product information , reports and business documents in this one .
all files are arranged alphabetically .
if you can &apos;t find what you are looking for , check the index .
i plan to clean out all the old files by tomorrow .
would you like to look through any of these before i throw them away ?
sales reports for this month are stored in the computer database under the file named &quot; sls : rpts . oct &quot; .
here &apos;s the stock portfolio you requested ma &apos;am . let me know when you are finished and i will refile it .
shall i close the file on the burns project and open a new one for the rogers account ?
a word processor is like a typewriter with a built-in eraser , copier , scissors and glue .
we can edit , replace , or move the text after it is typed in .
to use this word processor , you &apos;ll have to turn the computer on , put the program disk in drive # 1 and the work disk in drive # 2 .
load the program first and name the document you wish to work on .
for japanese work processing , you will also have to load the judugo dictionary .
the edit , disk , print and format commands are all listed in the &quot; help menu &quot; .
these function keys on keyboard let you edit the document . they allow you to cut , paste , copy or duplicate text .
this program allows us to add graphics to text documents , such things as letterheads , charts and diagrams .
the spreadsheet data is necessary for end of month reports and sales forecasting .
this spreadsheet contains all our sales and profit figures .
if one cell is changed , all related cells change to reflect those changes .
the columns represent sales categories while the rows represent the figures for different dates .
the cells in this table help us forecast future costs and profits .
i give my boss a printout of the data i have entered so that he can check for errors .
if i do not save the file regularly , i risk a complete loss of data if the program crashes .
a database is like a filing cabinet .
the &quot; files &quot; are like drawers , the &quot; records &quot; are like individual folders and the &quot; fields &quot; are like individual bits of information in the folder .
yesterday , i accessed the database to find how many tons of steel we have produced so far .
i searched the database for all records containing the heading &quot; steel production &quot; , and removed those records to extract data .
each record had a field showing production in tons , so i totaled those .
my favorite database program is the mail merge program that contains all the customer addresses .
after typing a form letter in the word processor , this program adds each customer &apos;s name , address and heading to copy of the letter and prints them all out .
the field in this database can be sorted either alphabetically or by date of entry .
electronic mail is just instantaneous mail .
instead of sending letters and documents on paper in envelopes , letters are sent as bits of electrical energy transferred through telephone lines from one computer to another .
mr. andrews asked me to log on to the telecommunications network and see if any electronic mail from japan is waiting for him .
i uploaded a letter too their terminal in the head office , and then downloaded a list of addresses from their database .
that network should not be used for this letter . it cannot support japanese characters .
please log on to a telecommunications database containing the dow jones stock information and see how well that company has performed since monday .
mr. jones needs the information immediately .
the modem is broken so we cannot access any other computer terminal .
if the wording on this telegram message meets your approval , i &apos;ll call the operator and send it immediately .
a message related to the bearings order posted two days ago has just come in by telex .
i am qualified as a telex operator although i have never used this model teletypewriter .
shall i contact the international telex service to check up on their rates ?
the charges are 70 cents per word with a minimum of ten words .
words longer than ten letters are charged extra .
ordinary telegram rates are less than urgent telegram rates .
hello , i am calling from hart printing .
we have finished the pamphlets you ordered and would like to deliver them .
when is the most convenient for you ?
if someone will be present , we could make the delivery as soon as thursday morning .
no , that will not be necessary .
we will bill you later .
could you give us directions on how to get to your office from the nearest highway exit ?
could you explain to him that i &apos;m sick and had to leave ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;ve got a fever . i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t attend the meeting .
i have to see the doctor .
i &apos;m sick and the doctor told me to rest for a few days .
sorry to hear that .
do you think you &apos;ll be back next week ?
i &apos;ll tell you if i won &apos;t .
why can &apos;t i take some vacation time ?
the boss says we are busy now .
but i have a really good reason .
christmas is an important holiday in my country . it &apos;s a time for family reunion .
in that case , i &apos;ll try my best to persuade him . i &apos;ll let you know later .
i &apos;m planning to take two weeks &apos; vacation in may .
you mean you want to up all your vacation for this year .
mr. wang , could you spare a few minutes ?
i &apos;m afraid i have to take off work next friday to attend my brother &apos;s wedding .
i &apos;ll tell the director about it .
how do you do ? my name is janet . i &apos;ll be training you for this position , so if you have any questions . i &apos;m the person to ask .
let &apos;s start with a brief tour around the department .
you will be assigned to the overseas orders section .
your desk will be next to mr. takada &apos;s .
he &apos;s the section chief .
mr. takada is very strict on appearance and punctuality .
things get rather hectic around the end of the month .
you &apos;ll probably have to work overtime occasionally .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to ask mr. takada about your salary .
he takes care of the information .
it &apos;s quite easy . you press that button and wait till the green light is on .
is it ready to be used then ?
no , not until you press this button .
look , all you do is repeat this code several times , then you &apos;ll remember it .
i can remember it now , but i &apos;ll forget it in a couple of days .
then just write it down before you forget .
make sure you remember to save first .
then you can exit and turn it off .
first you insert the card , then you dial the number .
i see . thank you .
first of all , you prepare a shopping list .
but i haven &apos;t got time to go shopping .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll do it for you .
you &apos;re so kind .
first you have to choose your partner .
can we start working right after that ?
no .
discuss it first .
first you read the report carefully , and then don &apos;t forget to have group discussions .
are we supposed to discuss the questions , too ?
yes , and then hand in your answers after that .
let me tell you how to cook it . it &apos;s like this : first you beat the eggs , and then mix in the flour gradually .
how about the potatoes ?
peel them first , and then slice them .
i &apos;ll try at the weekend .
this is how you do it : fill in the from and hand it in to the official , and then you go home and wait .
how long ?
let me show you . first you soak it , then add some detergent .
and the last thing is to rinse it with clean water , right ?
the first thing you have to do is tidy up this room .
i didn &apos;t know i applied for a job as a sanitation engineer .
newcomers clean the room . it &apos;s a rule .
i &apos;ve sold all the products . what shall i do next ?
well , the next thing you do is deposit your money in the bank , or leave it here for temporary safekeeping .
you do it like this : you hold the bat with you right hand , and toss up the ball with your left hand .
but i can &apos;t seem to hit the ball .
take it easy and keep practicing .
the first step is learn to operate the machine .
excuse me , sir . should we jot down some notes ?
no need to do it now. you have the instruction manual .
this is done as follows : insert the plug , and switch on the power .
can i operate it after doing that ?
yes , but don &apos;t forget to press the start button .
can i speak to mr. ben johnson , please ?
i &apos;m wang li from ford .
god morning , mr. johnson .
from ford ?
i &apos;m calling to check your travel details for your visit to our company next week .
wait a minute , let me check with my memo .
i &apos;m calling to confirm the arrangements for the meeting on the 15th .
ah yes .
could you tell me when you intend to arrive so we can make the necessary arrangements ?
i &apos;m arriving on the 14th .
could you tell us your flight number ?
the flight number is na407 .
and when does your flight arrive ?
at 10 : 35 .
and dr. white will come with me .
thank you very much for the information .
i think i told you my partner might come with me .
i &apos;m afraid i didn &apos;t know anything about it .
i &apos;ll try to make the necessary hotel arrangements for you .
are you staying at the rose again ?
i think that &apos;s all i need to know .
good morning . this is compaq .
hello , this is wang li from ford .
our manager has made an appointment with mr. jones for 1 : 30 this afternoon .
i &apos;m ringing to confirm it .
sorry , mr. jones is in a meeting .

good morning , i &apos;d like to talk to mr. carson .
sorry , he is not available now .
what time could i reach him ?
mr. carson will be in this afternoon .
i &apos;m ringing to confirm the meeting next monday .
sorry . mr. ford is out of town . i can &apos;t reach him .
so that means he may not be able to attend the meeting .
sorry , mr. smith . i don &apos;t quite catch you .
do you mean you &apos;d like to stay at the rose hotel again ?
yes , and my secretary will be with me .
i &apos;ll reserve two rooms for you right away .
i &apos;m ringing to tell you i won &apos;t be able to visit your company this month .
do you mean you &apos;re canceling the visit ?
yes , because i &apos;m tied up with something urgent .
my secretary will be in touch later .
hello , mr. wang , i &apos;m ringing to sort out my visit to new york next week .
i &apos;ll go and get the file .
won &apos;t be a moment . ok . i &apos;ve got it .
i want to go over my itinerary there and make some notes .
in that case , i &apos;ll come to your office right away .

how does 3 ; 30 sound ?

hello , bob , will it bother you if i change the time of our meeting ?
when exactly ?
would 4 : 00 be okay ?
i &apos;ll check my schedule and call you back .
mr. wang . could we meet at 8 : 00 tomorrow morning in your office ?
i &apos;m fully booked up tomorrow .
how about friday ?
i &apos;ll be free in the afternoon .
ok , see you then .
hello , mr. brown .
i want to remind you about the meeting tomorrow .
yes , i almost forget it .
where shall we have the meeting ?
the large conference room or the small one ?
the large one .
are you going to the party ?
i have to finish some work .
come on , it &apos;s a good chance to meet many important people .
ok , i &apos;ll mange .
i don &apos;t intend to chair the meeting .
i think bob is the best .
have you told him about it ?
not yet , but i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll agree .
i &apos;m leaving for london tomorrow .
when will you be back ?
i reckon i &apos;ll be back next friday .
if there &apos;re any problem , you can contact me .
yes , this paper needs filling out.can someone see to it while i &apos;m away ?
i &apos;ll tell our director about it .
i think the workload slows down for me next week .
why do you think so ?
i &apos;m going to pairs for training .
can mr. lee fly to germany next friday ?
sorry , i have to talk to him and make sure if he &apos;s free .
do let me know by this tuesday .
when , to be exact ?
how about 3 ; 30 ?
will it bother you if the time of our next meeting is changed ?
when ?
would 4 : 00 be ok ?
mr. wang , could i meet our director at 8 : 00 tomorrow morning in his office ?
i &apos;m afraid not.he &apos;s fully booked up tomorrow .
when do you think it &apos;s possible ?

i &apos;m afraid not . i have to finish my work .
come on , it &apos;s a good chance to meet some of our colleagues .

because i think bob would be better .
i reckon i won &apos;t be back till next friday .

why not change our coffee break to 10 o &apos;clock ?
let &apos;s check with others .
how about having the meeting today ?
we &apos;ll have a rather busy schedule tomorrow .
yes , let &apos;s talk it over with mr. lee .
i think we need to change the plan .
what do you suggest ?
ask jane for help .
we should have a non-smoking office .
a good idea .
but it &apos;s not realistic .
i &apos;m afraid we have to talk with the smokers first .
i think it &apos;d be a good idea to see the representative now .
i have to attend a meeting with the general managers .
it &apos;d be much better to put it off till tomorrow .
we &apos;re so busy today .
you look worried .
i &apos;m expected to finish it before 5 o &apos;clock .
but it &apos;s already 3 : 30 and i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t manage .
i &apos;ve got a fantastic idea.we can put an ad in the newspaper .
will it work ?
are you feeling ok ?
do you want to see a doctor ?
i &apos;ll think about it .
mr. black asked me to change our project a bit , but i &apos;ve got no idea , now .
you could talk it over with joe .
he is good at this kind of work , you know .
hi , mike !
hi , mr. wang !
how are you ?
hello , mary .
oh , hello , wang !
beautiful day , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is !
haven &apos;t seen you for ages !
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;ve been away on business for two months .
hi , susan !
how &apos;s everything ?
not so well . i &apos;ve come down with the flu .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that . take care .
hi , jack !
how are you doing ?
just so-so .
you &apos;re doing all right ?
same old thing .
how about your little son ?
he &apos;s great .
hello , george !
haven &apos;t seen you fro some time . where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been in pairs for the last two months .
very well , thank you .

how are you doing , jim ?
fine , just fine .
not too bad .
my name is jane greenwood .
glad to meet you .
i &apos;m wang ping .
nice to meet you , too .
you know what ?
john got a promotion
yeah . he worked very hard and he made it !
guess who i saw just now ?
who ?
mr. lee , the man who used to work here .
how &apos;s he doing ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
how come ?
you were here in the office most of the morning .
hi , mike !
what &apos;s new with you ?
nothing . same old thing . what about you ?
alive .
how &apos;s your child ?
he &apos;s really doing well .
you don &apos;t seem to be yourself today , jim .
i got a dressing-down from the boss .
kate , you know what i wish ?
what ?
i want to quit the job and travel all over the world .
may your dream come true .
but you &apos;ll have to work till you get enough money .
excuse me , where &apos;s the manager please ?
sorry , i &apos;ve no idea . but he &apos;ll be here this afternoon .
hot in here , isn &apos;t it ?
want me to open the window ?
i &apos;ll do it right away .
don &apos;t bother . let me do it .
there should be air-conditioning , don &apos;t you think ?
excuse me , can i ask you something , mr. jones ?
ok , go ahead .
do you happen to know mr. johnson in the sales department ?
how was your weekend , tony ?
it was wonderful . we climbed the mountain and camped on the top .
sounds great !
i have some good news for you , jack .
what is it ?
you &apos;re going to get a raise .
where did you hear that ?
don &apos;t you think that the sales are not so good as before ?
yeah . it &apos;s because of the economic recession .
maybe something is wrong with our strategy .
do excuse me , mr. green , may i ask you a question ?
what is it ?
what time do you think you can talk to mr. lee ?
i &apos;ll be free this afternoon . let &apos;s make it one o &apos;clock this afternoon .
sorry , i couldn &apos;t help overhearing . did you mention mr. white just now ?
yeah . why ?
he &apos;s going to be made manager of the department .
wouldn &apos;t you say that mr. lee is nice ?
yes ?
every time we have a problem , he &apos;s always ready to help .
no wonder he &apos;s so popular .
wouldn &apos;t you agree that three should be more strict rules ?
there &apos;s too much waste .
speaking of partners , have you ever done any business with the guys in bright star ?
they &apos;re honest and trustworthy .
you mean they &apos;re reliable , right ?
now that you mentioned it , i have to tell you i &apos;m planning to quit .
why ?
i don &apos;t &apos; think i can manage .
come on , you can do it well .
it &apos;s strange you should say that , because i was thinking of it myself just now .
what &apos;s your opinion ?
i agree with you .
we should apologize for it even though the customer is very picky .
apology won &apos;t do any harm to our image .
on the subject of the marketing , i don &apos;t think john &apos;s idea is practical .
he doesn &apos;t know our chinese customers .
but he &apos;s experienced .
he really is in america . but don &apos;t forget this is in china .
what a coincidence ! i watched the program , too .
what do you think of our manager on tv ?
marvelous !
funny you should say that .
i &apos;m going to visit him in person .
it &apos;s very kind of you .
that reminds me , i saw may crying in her office the other day .
perhaps she knew in advance .
i wonder why she was sacked . it &apos;s unfair .
sorry to interrupt , but did i hear you say paul won &apos;t attend the training class in sweden ?
he &apos;s got to finish his project .
what a shame !
he &apos;s the only person who shouldn &apos;t miss it .
about the holiday , i think egypt is the ideal place .
have you ever been there ?
no , but its consult the travel agency .
ok , let &apos;s consult the travel agency .
talking of sports , i like golf best .
i &apos;m interested in it , but i can &apos;t play well .
how about playing this weekend ?
i &apos;ll show you how to play .
you mentioned paris just now .
well , it &apos;s a romantic place .
never , but i &apos;m planning to go with my family this year .
i &apos;m jealous of you .
sorry about that . are you all right ?
yeah . do be careful next time .
did you bring the document ?
oh , no . i forgot .
oh , well . you &apos;ll better bring it to me tomorrow .
a thousand pardons for having given you so much trouble .
never mind .
i &apos;ll certainly pay more attention next time .
that &apos;ll be great !
try to do better next time .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll let you have another one .
it &apos;s very kind of you .
oh , my fault for the mistake .
let &apos;s forget it . that can happen to the best of us .
sorry , peter .
the trouble is that we have to change the lock .
i won &apos;t be that silly again .
i forgot to bring you the document .
i &apos;ll make sure you have it tomorrow .
listen carefully .
i &apos;ve got to go and see the guest off . it won &apos;t be long .
no problem . i &apos;ll be waiting for you here .
that &apos;s all right . what made you so late ?
i was tied up with some urgent business .
i &apos;m going to bring my colleagues with me . i hope you won &apos;t mind .
not at all . the more , the better .
it doesn &apos;t matter . what is it ?
i &apos;ve got two question to ask you .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve taken too much of your time .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m not busy anyway .
i apologize for what i said just now .
don &apos;t think my more about it .
and i do appreciate your concern .
i hope we can understand each other better in the days to come .
i had to take my little sister to hospital , you know .
there &apos;s no reason to apologize for such a trifling thing .
i certainly will try to make up for it .
forget it .
i must apologize for the delay .
apologies are really unnecessary .
we haven &apos;t been fully prepared anyway .
thank heavens !
it &apos;s not really important . i &apos;ll write another one .
it &apos;s all fault .
i can &apos;t tell how sorry for giving you such a fright .
there &apos;s no need for you to feel sorry . we &apos;re quite all right .
do you like classical music ?
yes , very much .
it has unfailing charm , doesn &apos;t it ?
i think so .
don &apos;t you like thrills ?
no , not at all .
why not ?
they &apos;re very exciting .
i think it &apos;s frightening rather than exciting .
what color are you fond of ?
dark blue .
oh , my favorite color is green .
do you like football or basketball ?
football .
are you keen on dancing ?
no , i don &apos;t know how to dance .
every time i try , my partner suffers .
that &apos;s a pity .

yes , thank you .

picasso .
i admire him , too .
i love your beautiful voice very much .

salads .
come to my home . i &apos;ll make you the best salad you &apos;ve ever tasted .
i &apos;ll take you up on that someday .
there &apos;s nothing i enjoy more than sightseeing .
i &apos;d rather stay at home watching tv .
don &apos;t you want to go sightseeing for a change ?
no , definitely not . it &apos;s too tiring .
i like all kinds of sports , especially swimming .
you look like you are in good shape .
i like reading novels best .
what &apos;re you reading now ?
jane eyre .
i like drama .
i &apos;m reading hamlet now .
i &apos;m fond of watching tv .
but i think it &apos;s a waste of time .
i don &apos;t think so .
i always learn something from it .
what do you like to do in your spare time ?
what i most enjoy is reading .
reading is fun .
i have the same hobby .
tom had an accident yesterday .
fortunately it wasn &apos;t serious .
what &apos;s the matter with john ?
his business went under .
that &apos;s really tough !
yeah , and it &apos;s a pity we can &apos;t help .
i hear your brother is seriously ill , is it true ?
yeah , he was down with a bad cold a week ago .
that &apos;s a shame , it really is !
is he all right now ?
much better .
john had a heart attack last night .
oh , really ?
is he all right now ?
not so good , though he was taken to hospital in time .
poor old john , i &apos;m ever so sorry .
oh , what a shame !
what is it ?
peter sprained hi ankle just now .
he &apos;s got to be more careful .
i failed .
how awful !
i should have been prepared for it .
don &apos;t be upset . i &apos;ll help you with it .
james &apos; wife passed away .
how terrible for james !
yes , he loved her very much .
i &apos;m sorry too hear you were seriously ill .
i never imagined that i could be so sick .
are you all right now ?
not really .
my boss told me i wouldn &apos;t have a holiday this summer .
it &apos;s a sad thing !
yes , i &apos;m tired of doing the same thing day after day .
you must have been very annoyed when you were reprimanded .
no , not at all .
i &apos;m to blame for my carelessness .
it &apos;s too bad .
jim was going to pick up your friend , but his car broke down .
how was your trip ?
my flight was delayed for two days .
oh , what a dreadful thing to happen !
old peter retired recently but he just cannot bear to stay at home .
i &apos;m most upset to hear that . he can do something . many old people are living a rich and full life .
yes , but he has to learn to adapt himself to this kind of life .
i &apos;m sorry to inform you that your director has cancer .
is it curable or not ?
it &apos;s incurable .
i &apos;m terribly sorry to hear that there &apos;s no hope .
i have some problems in my work , mr. white .

allow me to offer my warmest congratulations on your success !
i really appreciate your remarks .
i hope you &apos;ll have much more encouraging achievements .
you &apos;ve finished a very difficult operation , dr johnson .
yes . this operation was really a challenge to us .
i must congratulate you on your success !
it &apos;s very good of you to say so .
we &apos;re told that you will take charge of the sales department .
yes , but it hasn &apos;t been announced yet .
so i &apos;d like to the first to congratulate you .
it &apos;s very kind of you to say so .
i &apos;m going to take charge of the engineering department next month .
you &apos;ve been working hard . may i offer you my congratulations on your promotion ?
joe , what do you think of my plan ?
you are doing very well .
i &apos;m flattered .
i lost an important file !
don &apos;t be scared .
do you remember where you put it last ?
in this drawer . but it &apos;s missing now .
let me check again . oh , here it is .
thank you so much .
what happened in your interview today ?
i failed .
don &apos;t let this get you down .
i &apos;m sure you will find a good job .
you look upset .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i failed the competition .
cheer up , boy !
i believe you &apos;ll do better next time .
i heard you &apos;ve been promoted .
keep up the good work .
what a nuisance !
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve tried several times , but the computer won &apos;t work .
come on !
let me give you a hand .
so many people have entered their names for the contest .
you don &apos;t mean you want to give up ?
i don &apos;t think i will win .
have a try . you can do it !
tom , you did a good job in the negotiation .
i think there &apos;s a lot to learn .
i wish i could do as well .
i couldn &apos;t help it .
try again .
john , have a look at my project .
tom helped me a lot .
both of you did just fine .
this is a big project .
i &apos;m a bit nervous .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m right behind you .
glad to hear that .
this is third time i &apos;ve made the same mistake .
there is no reason to lose confidence in yourself .
be careful next time .
peter &apos;s bought a new car .
but the managed to talk his wife into buying the car somehow .
bill , where &apos;s the new pen you bought last week ?
i lost it .
i don &apos;t believe a work of it . tell me the truth .
michael lost $ 20 000 gambling .
that &apos;s incredible ! that &apos;s all he has !
it &apos;s really a disaster for him .
you &apos;re to be appointed as sales manager ! congratulations !
it &apos;s too good to be true ! you must be kidding !
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s very lucky for you .
i &apos;m not going to work with you and go on with the experiment .
you &apos;re not serious , are you ?
we &apos;ve cooperated very well up till now .
sorry . but i &apos;ve already decided .
that &apos;s too bad .
buy why ?
i can &apos;t credit his account of what happened yesterday .
he &apos;s trying to talk us into believing in his innocence .
mike , you &apos;re late again !
my sister was ill , so i.
do you think i &apos;d believe a story like that ?
well , the truth is i overslept .
it &apos;s reported that we must be cautious about earthquakes nowadays .
i have little confidence in what the newspapers say .
they &apos;re never reliable .
the ad says one must do exercise with their equipment to keep healthy .
i don &apos;t have great belief in ads . what they really want is to get more money out of your pocket .
i think there &apos;s a point in what you said .
look out !
you must have run over something just now .
that gives me the creeps !
i &apos;m worried sick that the documents won &apos;t be found .
there &apos;s no need to worry . the policemen are working hard on it .
i &apos;m really in a flap about the interview .
take it easy .
you &apos;re well prepared .
i really need the job that i can &apos;t afford any mistakes .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll pass it .
i &apos;m scared that the boss will let here go .
is it so serious ?
sure it is .
i was scared stiff of giving my first talk .
were you ?
it was tell received .
thank you for your kindly words .
i dreamt of god last night .
did you say hello to him ?
no , i was afraid to talk to him in case he would find out our dirty business !
i don &apos;t know what to do if i fail .
don &apos;t worry so much .
it &apos;s large sum of money . i can &apos;t afford to lose it .
do you like snakes ?
of course not . i &apos;m afraid of them .
i mean , do you like to eat snake meat ?
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;d feel sick at the sight of it .
i stayed with my friends .
you should have given me a call .
i met my uncle yesterday .
that &apos;s nothing special .
but my uncle died yeas ago .
oh , stop ? i &apos;m really terrified of those kinds of stories .
i was terrified out of my mind when the respectable board chairman was found to be a murderer .
i &apos;m frightened to fly for the first time .
what about you ?
well , i found it very exciting !
i &apos;m really terrified to witness the slaughter .
come on . you won &apos;t witness any slaughter . it &apos;s a movie .
but it &apos;s a movie reflects history .
i &apos;m worrying that she may be lost .
relax . she &apos;ll be all right .
but she has such a poor sense of direction .
ok . let &apos;s go out and look for her .
saying you wanted to kill yourself , you scared me out of my wits .
i was making a joke .
that &apos;s too much .
it &apos;s a worry to me whether she &apos;s able to deal with the matter .
i think she will .
she &apos;s not a green horn any longer .
i &apos;m not so sure .
did you hear that the subway would be attacked by terrorists ?
i never believe those stories .
i came across it in a leaflet found in town .
i must admit i was rather disturbed to read about it .
i fear for the bidding .
just relax .
there won &apos;t be any problem .
how can you be so sure ?
did you enjoy your trip to africa ?
yes . it was very exciting .
anything special ?
well , a lot .
once , i was petrified to see a huge rhino bearing down on me .
serious pollution in modem cities gives some cause for concern .
yes , we &apos;re breathing poisonous air every day .
i think it &apos;s time for the government to take action .
i absolutely agree with you .
do you mean this drug will clear up my trouble ?
mm , that isn &apos;t exactly right .
what do you mean by that ?
i mean this medicine will only relieve your pain .
why didn &apos;t henry turn up at the meeting ?
he must have got tied up at the office .
no , that isn &apos;t so . i met him in the elevator just now .
do you know tom in the sales department ?
yes .
he &apos;s a man of medium height . he wears glasses and has a moustache .
but that isn &apos;t quite correct . i think he &apos;s a tall man .
what &apos;s the result of the computer test ?
i &apos;m sure john has got a high mark .
as a matter of fact , he didn &apos;t pass the test .
it &apos;s really out of my expectation .
bob is working very hard and he even offered to work overtime .
as far as i know , he lost a large sum of money in gambling . he &apos;s working to pay off his debts .
he gambles ?
you &apos;ve taken me by surprise !
i &apos;m sorry to have interrupted you . what did you say just now ?
i said that no one has the right to impost his views on others .
jimmy ! have you heard that tom has been fired ?
but i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re correct about that . i heard he &apos;s been transferred to another department as a marketing manager .
why are you so depressed ?
because i can &apos;t find my camera . maybe i &apos;ve lost it .
well , the fact is that you didn &apos;t lose it at all . you put it in my bag at noon . remember ?
oh , yes !
look how expensive the printer is !
i think you might be mistaken .
why ?
because this price tag is for the computer .
what shall i do ?
i think i &apos;ve got enteritis . it &apos;s so painful !
if i may say so , it &apos;s actually not the case . it may be nothing but a slight infection .
are you a doctor ?
no , but my wife is .
have you got a lot of chinese antiques ?
yes . how about this one ?
it doesn &apos;t strike my fancy . what &apos;s more , it doesn &apos;t seem to be genuine .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , but i really should point out your guess is not correct .
what &apos;s this and what &apos;s that ?
do you know ?
this is a magpie and that &apos;s a nightingale .
if i may correct you , that is not a nightingale , but a golden orioles actually .
tom , what &apos;s your opinion about the meeting ?
it was a sheer waste of time .
tom , to my knowledge , you slept rather well during the meeting .
can you cover my phone calls when i &apos;m out ?
of course , where are you going ?
i &apos;ll pay a visit to microsoft .
no , only ten minutes &apos; walk .
tom , time for lunch .
hungry ?
oh , yes .
let &apos;s go to the lunchroom .
are you going for coffee ?
yes , would you like me to get you a cup ?
yes , thanks , black , please .
jane , could you do me a favor ?
what can i do for you ?
have john ring me if he comes back .
john , could you come here for a moment ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
i can &apos;t find my file .
le me see .
there it is .
oh , thank you .
it &apos;s five o &apos;clock .
time to call it a day .
shall we leave now ?
i wish i could , but i have to finish the work .
can i do something for you ?
no , thanks for asking .
did you hear that the meeting was postponed ?
no. who told you ?
mary .
where do you want to have lunch ?
it &apos;s up to you . i &apos;ve no preference .
do you like italian noodles ?
i &apos;ll bet john will be appointed as our new boss .
i &apos;d be glad if it &apos;s true .
what do you think of him ?
he &apos;s capable .
what do you think of my new dress , miss wang ?
wow , you look very elegant today .
i &apos;m glad to hear that .
but not for long . it &apos;s noisy outside .
ok , i just want to let in some fresh air .
it could have happened to anybody .
but i really feel depressed .
cheer up . it &apos;s not that bad .
maybe it &apos;s a blessing in disguise .
cheer up !
better luck next time .
don &apos;t think any more about it .
could i help you in any way ?
i think your ability will guarantee you a better job .
i &apos;ve just been given notice .
and i want you to know how very much i have enjoyed working with you .
joe , i &apos;m really sorry that this happened .
not having you have will be a real loss , and i will miss you .
thanks for stopping by .
how are you feeling today ?
not very well , i &apos;m feeling cold .
you don &apos;t look too bad . just take it easy .
i wanted to come yesterday when i heard you were sick .
thank you for coming all the way to see me .
i really hope you are feeling better soon .
do you feel better this morning ?
don &apos;t panic .
we have very good doctors here .
how are you feeling this morning ?
yes , i do .
but i &apos;m afraid that something will go wrong .
don &apos;t panic . we have very good doctors here .
it &apos;s a lovely day , isn &apos;t it ?
sure . it &apos;s quite clear .
i think it &apos;ll continue to be fine .
it sure will .
fairly warm this morning , isn &apos;t ?
you &apos;re right . the air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green .
how wonderful it would be to walk along the river !
i like this kind of weather .
yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon .
and it &apos;s calm . i like the peace .
it is a glorious day today .
i agree .
it &apos;s nice and bright today , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , the autumn is marvelous here .
tomorrow will be fine , too , i think .
i hope so .
the sun is shining .
but there &apos;re some mare &apos;s tails .
that &apos;s a sign of wind .
oh , really , i thought it was a sign of rain .
look ! it &apos;s a clearing up .
i can see the sun now .
i like summer as long as it &apos;s bright like this .
anyway , i dislike the summer here . there &apos;s too much rainfall .
it &apos;s getting warm today .
yes , it &apos;s much better than yesterday . but i still feel chilly .
it &apos;s fairly warm for this time of the year .
what lovely weather !
it &apos;s so pleasant after the bad weather we &apos;ve been having .
let &apos;s go out and enjoy the fresh sir during the break . ok ?
marvelous idea !
what a heavy thunderstorm just now !
but the rain is letting up .
look ! what a beautiful rainbow !
yes , it &apos;s sunny again .
look at the dark clouds . i think it &apos;s going to rain .
that &apos;s what is technically cumulonimbus .
what &apos;s that ?
the clouds that produce thunderstorms .
it doesn &apos;t look promising today .
what does the forecast say ?
they say it will be fine today .
but there &apos;re already snowflakes falling .
it &apos;s pretty cloudy , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it &apos;s getting dark ?
i feel suffocated .
it &apos;s going to be a heavy rain .
gosh , the rain is so heavy !
heavy ?
it &apos;s raining cats and dogs !
the cold is simply awful , i &apos;m freezing .
we &apos;re going to have a cold spell , i hear .
you mean it &apos;ll get even colder ?
yeah .
it &apos;s too sunny outside .
we &apos;d better say in .
look ! it &apos;s raining again .
it &apos;s been like this for a couple of weeks .
i wonder when it &apos;ll clear up .
the weatherman says it &apos;ll last for four more days at least .
i &apos;m freezing. it &apos;s terribly cold these days .
the weather forecast says there &apos;ll be hail tonight .
i wonder when the cold spell will pass .
it says the spell will last another six days .
i can &apos;t stand the cold here .
neither can i , especially the wind .
the north wind is biting and i &apos;m frozen to the bone .
look , the snow is setting in !
what beautiful snowflakes !
it must be wonderful to play in the snow .
yeah ! i enjoyed playing in the snow when i was a child .
excuse me , john , does the no. 23 bus go to holiday inn ?
are you sure ?
yes , i &apos;m positive about it .
hey , john &apos;s promoted .
i doubt it .
he &apos;s a quiet guy and not good at socializing with people . how could he win favor from our boss ?
but you forget he &apos;s a very efficient guy .
it &apos;s a nice idea , isn &apos;t it ?
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll work .
anything wrong ?
it &apos;s impractical .
john &apos;s plan is appealing , isn &apos;t it ?
but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too radical .
what about mary &apos;s ?
oh , her idea deserves more attention .
he doesn &apos;t like your plan .
so what ?
there &apos;s no better idea now .
he never likes others &apos; ideas and he never has any ideas of his own .
you should do nothing of the sort . you &apos;re my guest .
we &apos;re not talking about business .
let &apos;s compromise a little then . how about making it a dutch treat .
what is that ?
we each pay our own bill .
what do you think of the product ?
i will never buy it .
why not ?
the design is attractive , isn &apos;t it ?
the design is all right . but it hasn &apos;t passed the quality test . i &apos;d rather we didn &apos;t put it into market now .
excuse me , mr. wang .
what can i do for you ?
is there a post office around ?
yes , go two blocks down the street . you can &apos;t miss it .
are you sure of your id number , mary ?
i think this is the right number .
that &apos;s it . fill out the form , please .
hey , what &apos;s going on here ?
ann hurt her leg . we &apos;re taking her to the hospital .
let &apos; go together .
did you hear that the national bank was robbed last week ?
yeah .
how on earth did they manage to do that ?
god knows .
what did mr. green come here for ?
maybe he just came by and dropped in on us .
i wouldn &apos;t mind knowing about his real intention .
elizabeth is in a very difficult situation , you know that ?
yes , i &apos;ve heard about it .
i &apos;d give a lot to know more about it .
she is in love with her boss but her boss is not really serious . he &apos;s going with another girl .
did they find a way at last ?
yes , they worked out a plan .
i &apos;d love to know about it .
but they want to keep it a secret .
what &apos;s in your mind , cindy ?
you haven &apos;t moved a bit for a long time .
i &apos;m homesick .
oh , come on . your holiday is coming .
can someone tell me about the young man ?
we only know he &apos;s a relative of the director .
no wonder he behaves so differently .
the criminal who had killed three cops escaped last night ?
yeah . i got it from the newspaper .
did they catch him at last ?
no , he &apos;s still at large .
the human resource department says that four employees will be laid off .
yeah . but don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re definitely not one of them .
but what i &apos;d really like to find out is what kind of employees will be sacked .
i suppose it was dangerous to start the program , wasn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t think so .
they have made full preparations .
you seem to like the newcomer very much , don &apos;t you ?
i can &apos;t deny that .
i wish knew more a bout her .
maybe she &apos;s not the kind of girl you dreamed of .
how can you say that ?
why did he leave without telling anybody ?
we &apos;re also curious about that .
i wish someone would tell me something about it .
only god knows .
it must be wonderful being married , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s not as wonderful as you think .
you &apos;ll know that once you get married .
i wonder if you could tell me why the security department talked to david today .
it might be that they want to learn more about the leakage of our business secrets .
could it be david who did it ?
no idea .
. a man followed her to the house .
what happened then ?
she turned around and knocked the man down to the ground .
oh , that was interesting !
she &apos;s an amateur boxer .
mary and peter finally got the award .
i &apos;m most curious about how they achieved their success .
it was perseverance and determination .
you know something about the newcomer ?
a little .
i &apos;d particularly like to know about her past .
i &apos;m told she dropped out of school .
have you heard about the change in the management ?
yeah , everyone knows about it .
i &apos;d be most interested to discover how john became the manager .
it &apos;s mystery to all of us .
1the plan won &apos;t work .
i don &apos;t see how the plan can fail .
is there anything wrong with it ?
the plan is all right but we haven &apos;t the right person to carry it out .
what did you say ?
i said we failed .
i don &apos;t believed it !
we can &apos;t go wrong .
did you watch the match ?
there &apos;s no need . i know the visiting team is sure to win .
good guess .
our team always disappoints the fans .
so i say it &apos;s wise not to be a fan .
a weekend at the seaside is certainly to be enjoyable .
i can &apos;t agree with you more .
do you like the feeling of walking on a sandy beach ?
that &apos;s really nice !
i have no doubt of his success .
why are you so confident ?
because he &apos;s very diligent and intelligent .
how much is this make of dvd player ?
4 500 yuan .
does it work well ?
yes , i think you &apos;d love it .
how do you think the match will turn out ?
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll win it .
good luck !
when are we going to have the show ?
in a week or so .
will you go and watch it ?
that show will be wonderful , i &apos;m sure .
i &apos;m very worried .
i &apos;m always making careless mistakes .
take it easy . you have been making great progress .
you &apos;ll soon be all right .
how i wish what you said would come true !
i &apos;m not sure whether the result will be worth my effort .
your work is bound to be successful .
thank you for your encouragement .
i &apos;ll spend my holiday in the mountains .
how wonderful !
come along , will you ?
i &apos;d like to , but not this time .
i think you &apos;re bound to have a marvelous time .
what do you want to become in the future ?
i don &apos;t want to daydream now . i believe hard work will bring me everything .
you &apos;re going to be somebody .
what did the weather person say ?
the nice weather will last for another week .
so i &apos;m confident we can finish the work according to the schedule .
i wish you were right . i hate rain at this time .
i &apos;m very optimistic about the economic situation .
it will be stable at least .
and steady growth shouldn &apos;t be excluded .
how &apos;s your company going ?
not bad , after a poor first quarter .
what about its future ?
i &apos;m very optimistic that things will be even better .
do you think there will be another recession in the near future ?
there won &apos;t be another one .
how do you know ?
i anticipate success in effective economic control .
our products have entered the world market !
how wonderful ?
i feel quite sure that our company will develop faster than ever .
the more we export , the more we earn .
that &apos;s for sure .
do you think he will be promoted this time ?
yes . i have every confidence that he will .
just because he gets on well with everybody ?
partly , and he &apos;s also a hardworking and efficient man .
is she any better ?
much any now .
does she have to stay in hospital for a long time ?
no . i feel quite certain she &apos;ll recover soon .
what do you expect will happen to the company ?
hard to day .
what do you think ?
my expectation is that it &apos;ll take a turn for the better .
which do you like better , orange or lemon ?
i like orange better .
because orange is much more to my taste .
going to the cinema or staying at home watching tv , what &apos;s it to be ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned , saying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies .
but it feels so different to go to the movies .
how do mark and john compare , in your opinion ?
generally speaking , mark &apos;s personality is much more agreeable than john &apos;s .
may i venture to ask who you like better ?
the two young ladies are candidates for the position .
the fact is we only need one .
he choice is yours . miss . jones or miss smith ?
i prefer miss jones .
who &apos;s your favorite film star ?
tom hanks is always favorite film star .
what films have featured him ?
many !
which is more interesting to you , playing tennis or playing football ?
well , playing football is more fun to me .
i &apos;ve got no interest in football . but i &apos;m certainly crazy about tennis .
it looks like a lovely day tomorrow .
how about going for a swim or a picnic ?
for me , the best thing is to relax at home .
do you prefer working as an employees or being your own boss ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned , the best one is the latter .
i &apos;m sorry to say it &apos;s not easy to be a boss .
well , nothing is easy .
i favor the chinese team over all the others .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the best one , though .
i &apos;m chinese .
would you prefer riding a bike or riding a bus ?
on the whole , i find riding a bike more enjoyable than riding a bus .
i agree . and riding a bicycle will be better for your health .
which is your preference , tea or coffee ?
my choice would always be tea .
when did you form this habit drinking tea ?
since i came to china .
do you have any plan for your future ?
i &apos;d prefer to go abroad now , if possible .
many people want to go abroad nowadays . it seems to be a trend .
i just want to further my education in the states and then come back to china . actually there &apos;re more opportunities here in china .
we &apos;ve got everything ready .
shall we start now ?
best thing would be to have a check again .
yeah , you &apos;ve got a point there .
where would you like to have dinner ?
i don &apos;t care as long as it &apos;s a chinese restaurant .
you don &apos;t like western food ?
i really find chinese dishes more to my taste .
the meeting was supposed to begin at 9 o &apos;clock , right ?
yes , and it &apos;s already 9 : 30 .
but many members haven &apos;t turned up yet .
we could either put off the meeting or cancel it .
i leave it to you to decide .
which appeals more , dress designing or gardening ?
on balance , dress designing appeals to me more .
i don &apos;t know , i just feel that way .
you must be joking .
no , i &apos;m serious . she did marry him .
but he &apos;s more than eighty and she &apos;s only eighteen !
it &apos;s really more of our business .
wow ! my wallet !
what &apos;s happened ?
is it lost ?
no , i found two wallets in my pocket ! they look exactly the same .
good news , young man .
what is it ?
you &apos;ve passed the test .
i can &apos;t believe it !
boy ! what a beautiful girl !
i fell in love with her at first sight .
the girl next door ?
of course .
my goodness !
what happened ?
you have blood on your hand .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
i just killed a dog .
how could you have the heart to kill a dog ?
it has run over by my car .
what a surprise !
you had your hair permed ?
yes , and another surprise . i &apos;m going to get married next saturday .
you quit your job ?
yes . i &apos;m going to work in another firm .
that &apos;s amazing !
you got a good salary here , didn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s true , but i can get more there .
tom says he &apos;s going to the bank tonight .
he also says he &apos;s going to kill the president .
it &apos;s ridiculous , isn &apos;t it ?
to tell you me truth , he says whatever comes into his funny head .
oh , my god .
good heavens ! i thought ! i saw our boss in a car on the way here !
isn &apos;t he in the states ?
is he back now ?
we haven &apos;t received a phone call and he hasn &apos;t turned up yet .
it &apos;s really funny .
this really is a surprise ! you &apos;re home earlier than usual .
i &apos;ve got a bad cold .
the doctor told me to take a day off .
i &apos;m so sorry .
isn &apos;t that extraordinary ?
she got three gold medals medals at the olympic games .
show must be a superwoman .
not really . she began her training at the age of five . a very hardworking girl indeed . now she &apos;s only twenty .
he ate three bowls of rice and two chickens for lunch .
that &apos;s extraordinary !
it must have cost you a fortune .
i &apos;m lucky this time . he suggested going dutch .
i didn &apos;t realize it was so late ! i &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll miss the train .
don &apos;t worry . there &apos;s still five minutes left . we can take a taxi .
let &apos;s rush .
the newspaper says a father killed his son .
are you kidding ?
the son was so spoilt that he started to beat his parents and sisters .
how awful
i must say your words surprise me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
&quot; damn &quot; is taboo . you shouldn &apos;t use it on such a formal occasion .
we &apos;ve won the bidding !
fantastic !
we &apos;ve been working hard at it .
no pains , no gains .
may the project be just as successful as the bidding !
tom , our boss agreed !
well done !
so we can carry out the plan now .
yeah , let &apos;s try to make it a success .
we &apos;ve got a large order , bill !
we signed the contract this morning .
super !
it deserves a celebration , doesn &apos;t it ?
you let .
i managed to talk peter into our project .
good old wang !
we &apos;re sure to succeed with peter in it .
it &apos;s great to hear about your pay rise .
let me take you to the red rose , ok ?
we &apos;ve passed the quality test !
your boss won &apos;t pull a long face this time .
i got the first prized in the contest .
that &apos;s great !
i &apos;ll be transferred to headquarters , peter .
i &apos;m very happy for you .
have you told our colleagues ?
it &apos;s sure to be a pleasant surprise .
bob , i hear your department was praised by the general manager .
yeah , all of us tried our best .
congratulations !
liza , i &apos;m told you did very well in sales .
yes . i ranked first in sales profit this year .
congratulations on your success .
your brother is really going to study in oxford ?
yes , he &apos;s been admitted and he got the visa yesterday .
please send him my congratulations .
i &apos;m going to get married next sunday .
come to my wedding , will you ?
sure i will .
many , many congratulations on your wedding !
our research and development department was praised for our research .
let me congratulate you .
our product is well received in the market .
good news , isn &apos;t it ?
allow me to express my heartiest congratulations on your success .
it &apos;s very nice of you to say so .
all this routine work really browns me off .
oh , come on . you &apos;ve just started .
i wish i hadn &apos;t chose this job .
bother the flies !
where do they come from ?
i don &apos;t know . something rotten here ?
i can &apos;t see it .
do you like our new manager ?
i &apos;m fed up with this endless talk .
you can &apos;t say that !
he &apos;s a well-informed person .
i can &apos;t see it .
what do you think of working as a secretary ?
i &apos;m not at all keen on that sort of job . it makes me crazy .
you have to type all day .
that woman is a through drag !
she sneezes all the time .
maybe there &apos;s something wrong with her nose .
that guy &apos;s manner really turns me off .
yeah .
he never stops asking stupid questions .
maybe he &apos;s just dumb .
rock music really leaves me cold .
i &apos;m crazy about it .
then tell me what &apos;s good about it .
it can &apos;t be expressed by words .
driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind .
yeah . i think so . you have to be patient and careful .
i &apos;d rater walk or run to work .
you must be joking !
typing really bores me to death .
do you have to type every letter ?
yes , i &apos;m doing the secretarial job .
do you like watching football ?
i don &apos;t find it very exciting .
maybe you haven &apos;t found the magic .
i &apos;m really sick of waiting for buses .
yeah . especially when you have something urgent to do .
but a taxi costs too much .
that &apos;s true .
i find beijing opera is quite a bore .
young people enjoy pop songs more .
beijing opera is all creek to me .
but you don &apos;t have this problem with pop songs .
i &apos;m tired of dancing .
but to me it &apos;s really enjoyable .
maybe it &apos;s because you always have pretty girls as your partners .
what a boring film !
the acting of the heroine was too artificial .
and the plot was too simple .
what a bother having to climb so many stairs every day .
but it &apos;s also exercise and it &apos;s good for your health .
i don &apos;t care !
you &apos;re complaining again .
i must admit i &apos;m not at all interested in math .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll soon begin to like it . it &apos;s such an interesting subject .
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever like it .
what &apos;re you supposed to do now ?
the only thing for me to do is to get on the bandwagon .
yes , best to go along with it .
what did he think about the boss &apos;s decision ?
he wouldn &apos;t disagree ; he &apos;s learned to swim with the tide .
everybody has to do that in this society .
you &apos;d better water down your demand .
or the boss will turn it down at once .
don &apos;t argue any more . let &apos;s meet each other half way , ok ?
all right . it &apos;s good for you to say to .
only in this way can we close the deal .
things are becoming so difficult .
so i hope everyone of us will make the best out of a hard bargain .
yes , indeed .
do you want me to do it or leave it as it as ?
i don &apos;t mind one way or the other .
i should know better than ask you for advice !
we must figure out a way to settle the dispute .
yes , something has to be done .
but it &apos;s not easy .
how on earth will they end the strike ?
they &apos;ll have to give in on both sides , i think .
but neither of them wants to .
then the strike will last forever .
are you in favor of this plan ?
not really . but we &apos;ve finally decided to play long with his ideas for the time being .
what do you mean by that ?
we agreed with him tempoarily .
i think we &apos;d better reach a compromise .
unfortunately , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s room for compromise in this matter .
it seems we &apos;ll never reach any agreement .
we shouldn &apos;t dress very formally on the occasion .
yeah , we should be casual when we stay with these people .
when in rome , do as the romans do .
did you finally work out a compromise ?
no , we couldn &apos;t .
they wouldn &apos;t give in ; neither would we .
i find it hard to get on with my colleagues .
you need a give-and take attitude to get along in this firm .
thank you for your advice .
if we want to reach an agreement , we should make mutual concessions .
you said it . as long as we do that , we &apos;ll reach an agreement .
that &apos;s right .
what &apos;s the result of the dispute ?
we finally settled it amicably .
just as i expected .
their charge is a bit too high .
you have to split the difference .
that &apos;s the thing to do .
will our boss agree to change the plan ?
no , he &apos;s still taking a hard line . he has ordered us to finish our work according to the schedule and he &apos;ll never change his mind .
he &apos;s really tough .
yes . when he announces a plan , all of us fall into line .
you never reject his ideas ?
never reject his ideas ?
never . he &apos;s the boss , you know .
i finally backed down on my plan .
i though you would stick to it .
i couldn &apos;t simply because so may people have different opinions .
come here , joe . let me tell you something bad .
what is it ?
you &apos;ll be put into prison .
come off it !
let &apos;s cut tomorrow &apos;s work and climb the hills , ok ?
don &apos;t be so silly !
mr. green will be mad at us .
i &apos;m only joking .
linda is a trustworthy friend of mine .
i can &apos;t agree .
she talks about you behind your back all the time .
i think there &apos;s sure to be a nuclear war in the coming century .
i wouldn &apos;t say that .
if that were true , people would be inviting self-destruction .
then why are so many countries eager to develop their own nuclear weapons ?
let &apos;s wait here a moment .
i don &apos;t like the idea of waiting at all .
what do you think we should do ?
go straight to him home and call for him .
i think capability is the most important quality for an employee .
i hate to disagree with you , but i still think honesty is even more important .
working hours should be flexible .
don &apos;t you think so ?
i wish i could agree with you , but it &apos;s only suitable for some jobs .
china will eventually become a superpower in my opinion .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t agree with you there .
chinese leaders have already said china will never be a superpower .
but things will change , you know .
other countries may , but i don &apos;t believe china will .
is joe in ?
don &apos;t talk to me about that fellow .
we quarreled yesterday .
i can &apos;t stand his rudeness .
how annoying !
someone took my briefcase by mistake .
what a nuisance !
the weatherman says it &apos;ll be cold tomorrow .
i expected to go picnicking with my family .
that &apos;s the limit !
what &apos;s the matter ?
i &apos;ve told paul several times to knock at the door before coming in ! but he &apos;s forgetting things all the time .
have you talked your plan over with smith ?
don &apos;t talk to me about him .
his indifference really irritates me .
why on earth don &apos;t you tell me the truth ?
well , i did .
i want to see your manager .
oh , damn it !
what &apos;s going on ?
i might have left my paper in the restaurant .
don &apos;t worry .
just go and ask the waiter if anyone has it .
we have to work overtime this weekend .
oh , no !
i &apos;ve had just enough of it , too .
have you read the notice on the board , mr. wang ?
no , what &apos;s it about ?
there &apos;s a meeting this afternoon .
this is the third meeting this week . i &apos;m fed up with them .
you shouldn &apos;t be so rude to her .
none of our business .
i simply can &apos;t bear to see you behave so badly !
why are you upset ?
bob asked me to revise my plan .
you know i &apos;ve been working on it for the whole afternoon .
it really makes me mad .
let &apos;s see if i can be of any help .
what a fool !
who are you talking about ?
peter .
he told my secret to ann .
i really hate being betrayed .
watch out ! don &apos;t cut your fingers !
it &apos;s not sharp at all .
better be careful .
mind the wet paint ?
when was it painted ?
it was just done yesterday .
watch it !
you &apos;ll knock the glass over !
oh , it &apos;s your favorite glass !
no . i &apos;m just afraid you &apos;ll get hurt .
leave the dog alone !
it might bite you .
be sure no to try to read a girl &apos;s mind .
but that &apos;s my favorite hobby .
you must be in trouble all the time then .
don &apos;t touch that flower !
because that kind of plant is poisonous .
you &apos;d better not buy stocks these days .
i think it &apos;s a good investment .
if you don &apos;t follow my advice , you &apos;ll lose your shirt .
you &apos;re too close to the fireplace . be careful of your clothes .
thank you for your warning , but my clothes are make of asbestos .
that &apos;s fabulous !
don &apos;t try any tricks .
someone cheated last time and he got away with it .
he &apos;ll answer for his dishonesty some day .
how did he get involved in it ?
you stay out of it and mind your own business .
be careful not to stain the papers .
they &apos;re not so easy to stain .
look , i &apos;ve already got one stained .
be aware of those who fish in troubled waters .
are you giving me a hint ?
well , i &apos;m just reminding you of your experience last year .
what do you think of his behavior yesterday ?
he doesn &apos;t seem to be so birdbrained .
he must have been annoyed by something yesterday .
i &apos;m fed up with all this treatment .
w have to bear it , since we &apos;re employees .
who days employees can be maltreated ? i &apos;d rather leave this company .
i can &apos;t stand her arrogance .
she looks down upon everybody .
maybe it &apos;s her nature .
i &apos;ll let her know i &apos;m not the one to be bullied .
i think you &apos;d better leave her alone .
it really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens .
don &apos;t be so angry . it &apos;s passed anyway .
i can &apos;t forget it .
you &apos;d better cool down .
what on earth does he mean ?
take it easy .
he &apos;s driving me crazy .
you &apos;ll get used to him soon .
why are you holding your nose ?
i just can &apos;t stand the odor . it stinks .
why not open the window ?
it &apos;s even worse outside .
i simply can &apos;t bear your barbaric behavior .
don &apos;t pretend that you &apos;re so good .
you should feel ashamed of yourself .
i really hate waiting .
i &apos;m sorry . i had something urgent to deal with just now .
you should have told me earlier .
it was too late to inform you .
look here , what a mess he &apos;s made !
maybe he didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
but this indifferent attitude irritates me .
he &apos;s always like this .
i &apos;m very annoyed at your rashness .
i did mess it up .
you should have asked for my opinion before you do it .
i will next time .
i wish you wouldn &apos;t be so selfish .
selfishness is just human nature .
but you should at least consider others .
don &apos;t be so angry with him . he &apos;s your colleague after all .
but he doesn &apos;t treat me as an equal .
it &apos;s just a misunderstanding .
he &apos;s never satisfied with anything i say or do .
what are you doing , jack ?
computer games . it &apos;s interesting !
what &apos;s that ?
what a brilliant star !
look there . one more !
ah , how beautiful !
why don &apos;t you just stop talking and watch ?
please ask when you take my things next time .
don &apos;t be angry . i &apos;ll pay you double when i get rich .
by the time you get rich , i &apos;ll be crazy already .
i &apos;m coming to the end of my patience .
why is that ?
they keep on disturbing me with their problems .
they turn to you because they trust you .
john ! i &apos;ve told you twice to throw these papers away . why are they still here ?
don &apos;t be cross .
i just thought you might need them .
the thing that really annoys me is that you don &apos;t take my words seriously .
i &apos;m not at all pleased by your negligence .
we feel terribly sorry .
apologies don &apos;t get the money back .
why did she marry a man old enough to be her father ?
you &apos;d better mind your own business .
i &apos;m just curious .
do you think she loves him ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
hurry up , henry !
everybody is waiting .
i &apos;ll be ready in a minute .
change your clothes , and be quick about it .
has the work already begun ?
yes , it started ten minutes ago .
come on quickly , or we won &apos;t be able to finish the work .
take it easy . the boss is away .
we &apos;re not kids . don &apos;t play hide-and-seek .
get moving ! or you &apos;ll be late !
don &apos;t worry .
you will when your boss lets you go .
may i come in ?
it &apos;s raining and i have no umbrella with me .
come in. you &apos;re wet .
come on , the taxi &apos;s waiting downstairs .
my luggage is too heavy . i can &apos;t move it .
let me help you .
oh , you &apos;re so kind .
look sharp !
don &apos;t dawdle about like that .
i don &apos;t want to have the interview .
it &apos;s your last chance . be a man !
do you want to go and have a look ?
you set ?
then put on your coat and run along now .
hurry up , mike !
we &apos;re waiting for you .
i &apos;m coming .
i hope we won &apos;t be late .
don &apos;t worry . we won &apos;t .

let &apos;s speed up .
we &apos;re going to be late again .
can we make it if we hurry ?
step lively , please .
you &apos;re twenty minutes late already ?
i don &apos;t see any point in going there since i &apos;m already late .
better late than never .
try to hurry a little more , will you ?
i &apos;m too exhausted to work any more .
come on . you can manage it .
i think you &apos;d better get going .
right . it &apos;s already 7 : 30 . i &apos;m supposed to have an interview at 8 : 00 .
good luck !
don &apos;t you think we should leave for the fair now ?
what time will it start ?
in about 25 minutes .
then we &apos;d better get going .
is your flight at nine ?
you &apos;re right . why ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to hurry . it &apos;s 8 : 20 .
ok .
please be quick .
is everyone there ?
yes , they &apos;re looking forward to seeing you .
sorry , i got caught in a traffic jam on my way here .
scientists say that people will be able to live on the moon in the future .
i &apos;ll take your word for it . but is it possible in our lifetime ?
i &apos;m not sure .
i believe alex will wait for me at the gate .
so what time did you make it ?
at 9 : 30 .
then you &apos;d better hurry up . there &apos;s only 5 minutes left .
did you finally forgive him for not meeting you at the station , mary ?
yeah .
i trust his explanation .
what did he say ?
he said his mother was ill , so he had to take her to hospital .
i don &apos;t doubt that jane will continue to work here .
but i hear she &apos;s returning to her country .
no , she &apos;ll stay for another year .
what do you think of mr. thompson ?
i feel confident of his ability to manage the business here .
how can you be so sure ?
i can tell from the way he spoke to us .
do you think he &apos;ll be here to help us ?
i &apos;m fully convinced of his honesty .
oh , look !
he &apos;s coming .
i heard richard won the prize yesterday .
i can believe it .
he practiced a lot .
every dog has its day !
i haven &apos;t got enough right now .
i &apos;ll pay your money back next monday .
i &apos;ll accept what you said .
but be sure not to delay it any more .
you bet i won &apos;t .
all right if i take a few days off ?
please do .
then you &apos;ll have to do the work all by yourself .
is fishing allowed in the take ?
no , you &apos;ll be fined if you try that .
oh , than you for telling me .
ok if i play the flute now ?
all right , but wait till i call the doctor .
in case i am driven crazy by your magic flute .
my god .
i &apos;d better not play it .
go ahead . i &apos;m only joking ?
can i go home on vacation ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why not .
you need my help , don &apos;t you ?
yes , but i think i can mange .
could i have a computer of my own ?
sure , if it &apos;s necessary .
do you mind if i open the window ?
no , not all .
it &apos;s stuffy in here , isn &apos;t it ?
it sure is .
would it be all right if turn in the report next monday ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t finish it by friday .
well , you &apos;ve been putting it off for quite a few days .
i was wondering if i could go fishing on sunday .
i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;ll have a negotiation next monday .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m well prepared for it .
would you mind if smoke here ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t mind at all .
thank you . it &apos;s nice of you .
by the way , would you have a smoke ?
would it be possible for me to put off the work till later ?
well , i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t if you don &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s not so urgent , is it ?
no. but it &apos;s a bad habit to delay doing things .
don &apos;t put off till tomorrow what you can do today .
do you think i could put my documents here ?
yes , please do .
there &apos;s plenty of room .
are people allowed to marry twice in china ?
i mean , is it legal to have two wives or two husbands at the same time ?
definitely no .
but in the post , a man could have as many wives as be pleased .
it was true of religious group in america years ago .
i &apos;m told a man can have many many wives in some countries even nowadays .
that &apos;s ridiculous !
do i have your permission to sit in the front of the auditorium ?
those seats are saved fro the vips .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can take seat in the back .
i hope you don &apos;t mind my borrowing your pen for a moment .
sorry , i &apos;m using it myself .
ask jim .
may i use your umbrella ?
certainly . it &apos;s not raining , is it ?
no , it &apos;s sunny and bright .
i want to take a picture with an umbrella .
would you object if i turn off the radio ?
no. it &apos;s noisy , isn &apos;t it ?
i wonder why the radio doesn &apos;t have good reception these days .
the signals are weak , i think .
can i use your car , jim ?
sue , go ahead .
thank you . then i don &apos;t have to suffer in the crowded buses .
that &apos;s why i drive to work everyday .
would you mind of i put my coat here ?
no , of course not .
go ahead .
could i open the window ?
well , i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t if you don &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s very draughty when you open the window .
just leave the door open .
how is your report ?
ok , we &apos;re working around the clock .
is there anything i can help you with ?
no , thanks for asking .
can i help you , wang ?
yes , i want to know what &apos;s the latest on our project ?
it &apos;s almost done .
how long do you have to get the project done ?
two days .
i think you are behind schedule .
our customer is arriving on friday .
i &apos;m sure we can work it out .
what do you think of my plan ?
sorry , i didn &apos;t quite follow you .
let me explain it again .
this is not what i had in my mind for our project .
and about do you suggest ?
i think this part should be omitted .
we &apos;re scheduled to meet mr. white on thursday .
but we haven &apos;t finished our report yet .
well , i &apos;ll get tom to give you a hand .
hello , this is wang li .
i &apos;d like to talk to mr. carson .
sorry , he is not in .
could i leave a message ?
tell him i rang , please .
mr. wang , i can &apos;t find the document on abb .
can &apos;t be true .
i &apos;m certain the document is filed .
let me see . oh , here it is .
peter , why not change our coffee break to 10 o &apos;clock ?
i &apos;ve no objections at all .
let &apos;s check with mrs. adela .
what are you going to do this weekend ?
i &apos;ve no idea .
how about golf ?
i &apos;m in favor .
i think i need to change the cover .
i agree .
what would you suggest ?
i &apos;ve no idea .
you ca ask jane for help .
we should have a non-smoking office .
what do you say ?
but it &apos;s not realistic .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;d better talk with the smokers first .
i think it &apos;d be a good idea to play tennis after work .
don &apos;t count me in .
why ?
i have to finish the project today .
remember the meeting this afternoon .
it &apos;d be much better to put it off ill tomorrow .
we &apos;re too busy today .
you look worried .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m expected to finish it before 5 o &apos;clock .
but it &apos;s already 3 : 30 now .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t manage .
don &apos;t worry . let me give you a hand .
that &apos;s very nice of you .
i &apos;ve got a fantastic idea . we can put an ad in the newspaper .
do you think it will work ?
sure .
leave it to me .
you don &apos;t look very well these days .
i feel very tired .
maybe ought to see a doctor .
i &apos;ll thing about it .
mr. black asked me to change it a bit , but i &apos;ve got no ideas .
you might as well talk it over with joe .
he &apos;s good at drawing , you know .
i &apos;d like to suggest you write a report about the event .
when do you want it ?
oh , tell jack i &apos;d like to see him .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t talk now .
i have to attend a meeting .
how long will it last ?
about an hour .
if it &apos;s all right with you , i &apos;ll come in an hour .
you &apos;d better ring me first just in case .
all right . bye .
i &apos;m losing my temper .
i &apos;m fed up with your vulgar language .
that &apos;s really too much !
i can &apos;t stand your vulgar language any more .
it &apos;s rumored that he &apos;s going to resign .
don &apos;t believe all the gossip you hear .
i heard a rumor that he had gone bankrupt .
don &apos;t spread rumors , or you &apos;ll ruin his reputation .
thanks for reminding me .
i hear that the price will go up next month .
i can &apos;t see any sign .
we must spike that rumor .
do you know that mr. johnson was arrested fro bribery ?
don &apos;t believe the gossip you heard .
it &apos;s already been in the newspaper .
laura must be having an affair with our boss , otherwise she would not have been promoted .
that &apos;s not true . she has worked harder than all the rest of us put together and earned her promotion .
she is hardworking , but .
you are setting yourself up for a big slander lawsuit if you keep this up .
laura has earned every bit of the credit she &apos;s received .
so cut it out .
you said you would let us know about the factory plan today . i wonder if .
come to my office in five minutes , and i &apos;ll talk about it with you .
do you still remember what we talked about last week ?
well , i can &apos;t think of it at the moment .
mr. brown is a very reliable client of our company .
yes , i &apos;ve promised that we &apos;ll go and visit him this week .
i don &apos;t know how to put it .
just tell me the truth .
you borrowed $ 200 from jack last month , and the needs it badly .
oh , i &apos;m really sorry .
do you see what i mean ?
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not clear yet .
do you mean you will not give me your support ?
shouldn &apos;t we consult the others ?
george , can i have a word with you ?
yes , please .
i think you &apos;re just terrific . so i &apos;m taking a chance you won &apos;t be offended if i tell you your breath can be really strong sometimes . i hate to tell you this , but i wouldn &apos;t feel like a friend if i didn &apos;t .
what day is today ?
tuesday ?
yeah . i bet you didn &apos;t forget anything .
what &apos;s the date today , do you know ?
i bet it &apos;s may the 5th .
what day is it ?
thursday .
so the weekend is coming !
i hear a new film is on . how about seeing the film ?
when were you born , may i ask ?
on june 1 , 1960 .
june 1 . that &apos;s children &apos;s day .
no wonder you &apos;re always youthful and energetic .
what time is it , please ?

can you tell me the time ?
i &apos;ve got an appointment at 4 : 30 .
it &apos;s 4 o &apos;clock sharp by my watch .
gee ! there &apos;s only 30 minutes to go .
have you got the time ?
my watch says half past five .
does your watch keep good time ?
oh , yeah . it loses only a few seconds in whole month .
could you tell my the time ?
of course , it &apos;s a little after four .
that &apos;s good . we have time .
let &apos;s be quick and finish the report .

do you like playing tennis ?

several years ago .
do you mind retiring earlier ?

that way , i can do something of my own .
i do mind . i don &apos;t know what to do after i retire .
i &apos;d like to work till i drop .
would you like to join that company ?
why do you want to join it ?
it &apos;s more exciting , i think .
would you like to buy a house ?
you let , as long as i can save enough money .
i can lend you some .
offer to lend me money ?
are you crazy ?
do you want to try your hand at insurance ?
certainly i do .
it seems you like the idea .
i &apos;d be happy to try selling insurance .
it &apos;s challenging , isn &apos;t it ?
could you tell me the way to the company ?
yes , of course . i &apos;d be pleased to .
i broke some traffic regulations yesterday and i got a ticket .
could you tell me how you dealt with it this time ?
certainly , as long as you don &apos;t tell my wife .
would you like to have this ?
yes , i would , as long as it &apos;s good quality .
you can check it , sir .
do you need a ticket ?
surely i do .
they &apos;re hard to come by , aren &apos;t they ?
can you get one ?
you can be assured of it .
would you like me to fill out the form ?
i suppose so , but wait a minute . i &apos;ve got to tell you how to do it .
would you allow me to drive your car ?
no problem , but you &apos;ve got to be careful .
of course i will .
here &apos;s the key then .
why not come over to work in my company ?
i need to think it over .
tell me what you need .
all right . i &apos;m prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .
i want to leave the motorbike outside .
you &apos;d better not .
why not ?
it might be stolen .
will you give me a hand , sir ?
that &apos;s a shame . our team lost yesterday &apos;s match .
oh , come on . you can &apos;t always win .
i hope the rest of our players think so , too .
just our luck to have lost the key .
you should have been more careful .
it &apos;s too bad because this is the only key i have .
pity , really , we have to cancel our party .
because the singer we invited is ill .
we have no other choice .
i was told my friend joe was speaking ill of me . that &apos;s a real letdown .
i don &apos;t think joe would do such a thing .
oh , no !
my wallet is missing .
where did you put it ?
in my handbag . but it &apos;s gone now .
search your pockets . maybe you &apos;ve put it there .
it &apos;s too bad that the shop is closed .
i want to buy a birthday cake for my son .
you can try the shop round the corner . they sell very goods cakes .
thank you very much for telling me .
it &apos;s a great pity he left suddenly .
yeah , it &apos;s very embarrassing .
how very disappointing !
we were just setting out when it started to rain . and we had to turn back .
next time we &apos;d better listen to the weather report carefully .
i &apos;m very disappointed at the new office . i &apos;d expected it to be much better .
don &apos;t be so particular . it &apos;s much better than mine .
john , i &apos;m sorry to hear about your mother &apos;s illness .
it was so unexpected . she was in great health last week .
don &apos;t worry . everything will be fine .
to my great disappointment , rose failed again .
but she &apos;s determined to work hard from now on .
i could kick myself , really .
i make a fool of myself at the meeting .
oh , forget it ! nobody will laugh at you .
today just isn &apos;t my day .
why do you say that ?
my car hit an old woman in the morning and i feel terrible about it .
oh , that &apos;s bad !
rotten luck !
we &apos;ve run out of gas .
then we &apos;ll have to get out of the car and run to our office . our boss may have already been there .
let &apos;s hurry up .
look at the sketch . it &apos;s ruined again .
things do go wrong sometimes . that &apos;s nothing unusual .
start again , will you ?
i wish i had never taken this job .
i &apos;ve got a lot on my mind .
my best friend passed away yesterday .
oh , i &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
why are you feeling depressed , david ?
my girlfriend and i just split up .
oh , cheer up . a girlfriend is not everything .
but i just can &apos;t forget her .
oh , god ! just don &apos;t know what to do . i was sacked .
why ?
because the boss saw me sleeping at work .
but i was too tired to work , you know .
i feel such an idiot !
i told my boss the truth that i skipped work because i was busy .
you shouldn &apos;t have said that .
i &apos;m wang li .
i &apos;m a newcomer .
good morning , everyone .
please allow me to introduce myself .
my name is wang li .
how do you do ?
mr. wang , let me show you around and meet some of the staff you &apos;ll be working with .
let &apos;s start with mr. smith .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
mr. wang , i &apos;d like you to meet mr. brown , our manager .
how do you do , mr. brown ?
how do you do , mr. brown ?
i &apos;ve heard a lot about you ?
hi , wang , ready to work today ?
yeah , what should i start on ?
mary will tell you .
wang , i want you to meet our manager mr. sydney carson .
it &apos;s a please to meet you . i &apos;m wang li .
pleased to meet you .
may i introduce myself ?
hi , i &apos;m steven keats .
glad to meet you .
nice to meet you . too .
oh , here is david .
david , meet wang li , your new colleague .
wang , meet jack .
hello , i think we &apos;ve met before in mr. white &apos;s office .
yeah , nice to see you again .
sweetie , let me kiss you .
my name is mary , not sweetie .
please call me mary .
and this is the office , mr. smith .
mr. johnson , may i have a talk with you ?
yes , please , honey .
i &apos;ll really appreciate it if you didn &apos;t call me &quot; honey &quot; of &quot; the prettiest senior vice president in the company &quot; in your introduction of me to others .
oh , my dear , you look very sexy .
steve , i really enjoy working with you and feel we make a god term . but it has to be all business .
i don &apos;t appreciate your innuendoes .
please don &apos;t touch me . this is the office .
nobody is here except us two .
if you don &apos;t stop . i &apos;ll report it to our boss , mr. smith .
bring us a pot of tea , alice .
you are closer to the pot , james ; it &apos;ll be easier for you - and while you &apos;re there , i could use a refill too !
thanks so much .
can you take notes at this afternoon &apos;s meeting ?
suppose someone else take notes this time - took them at the last three meetings .
oh , yes .
maybe mary can do it .
please write a summary of our monthly report .
it &apos;s not my turn yet - there are quite a few other people who haven &apos;t done it yet .
alice , can you get my fax ?
mr. smith , i &apos;ve done it many times .
now i &apos;m very busy , i wonder if you can take mine for me .
tomorrow is your birthday , jane , isn &apos;t it ?
thanks for your kindness , but i prefer to celebrate my birthday quietly at home .
oh , that &apos;s too bad .
you have a big salary , john .
more than my boss thinks it should be , and less than i want it to be !
whenever i mention your salary , you always try to avoid it .
this is not an acceptable question , and it &apos;s nothing i care to discuss with you .
is your pregnancy planned , jane ?
i thought you would tell how really happy i am .
can you tell me something about your romance , jimmy ?
oh , i think you all have much more exciting lives than i do .
i wonder if you can share your romantic story with us ?
there &apos;s nobody really special in my life right now although i have a lot of friends i enjoy spending time with .
we hear that you &apos;re passionately in love , with whom ?
can you tell us ?
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve made a mistake . i haven &apos;t fallen in love with anyone .
are you getting divorced , elizabeth ?
i &apos;m very sad about it .
can we talk about something else ?
oh , sorry to mention it .
lily , mr. smith told you to go to his office .
mr. lee , i hope you &apos;ll continue to use my first name when we &apos;re alone , but company rules are that we use mr. or mrs. or ms. or miss when other people me around .
jack is very snobbish .
he &apos;s totally warm to our boss , but cold to us .
i don &apos;t like comments that belittle people .
can we talk about the football match ?
he must quarrel with his wife very often .
how can you draw such a conclusion ?
because he &apos;s very easily agitated at work .
he &apos;s neighbor of mine .
i &apos;m under the impression that be and his wife live a very happy life .
i hear your boss is very hot tempered .
i &apos;m afraid what you were told about him is not quite true .
if you could meet him in person , you &apos;d probably like him .
i hope to meet him soon .
did you see my file , alice ?
jane . working with you is like living with my old roommate - she was a very nice girl but never emptied her ashtray or washed her coffee cups .
could you clear up before you leave ?
it &apos;s a lot easier for us to find things if they are put away .
have a cigarette , please .
no , thanks .
john , you &apos;re smoking too much . i &apos;m worried about your health .
that &apos;s all right .
but you &apos;d better empty the ashtray when you leave .
see you tomorrow , jack .
john , please clean up before you go .
i hate having to do your housekeeping chores before i can get started working .
do you know where my fax of april 14 is , mr. smith ?
sorry , i don &apos;t know .
if you sort out all your files , you can locate them much more easily .
thanks for your advice .
can i use your fax paper , jack ?
i can &apos;t find mine .
it &apos;s in your file box .
if you organize all your things , you can work more efficiently .
i &apos;m afraid that all hiring is done out of the personnel section .
let me refer you to that office .

how do you do , mrs. ness .
my name is kimiko obashi . i &apos;m on the secretarial staff here .
i &apos;ve often heard nice things about you from mr. ness , so i &apos;ve looking forward to meeting you .
oh , yes , mr. ness treats us all quite well .
we have to work hard for him , but everyone likes him a lot .
mr. ness , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt you , but your wife has just arrived .
it is customary in our country to take your shoes off before entering a tatami mat room .
please leave your shoes here and you can use these slippers i &apos;ve prepared for you .
i &apos;ve placed chopsticks with your lunch , but if you would prefer a knife and fork , you &apos;ll find those next to your lunchbox too .
please sit on this cushion in whatever way you find most comfortable .
i am not sure how well you know this custom , but this means ..
i suppose things are a little bit more crowded here than in you country , but please bear with us .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not very familiar with the islamic religion , so i would be very grateful if you could tell me if anything is unacceptable to your faith , or if there is anything i could do to help you fulfill your religious requirements during your stay .
please leave your tools in this area .
i &apos;ve also been asked to tell you that we mush have this work finished by tomorrow .
let me show you where the fusebox is in case you need to shut the electricity off .
if you need to wash up afterwards , please use this room .
here &apos;s our warranty .
it &apos;s still valid since we just bought this a couple of months ago .
the boss would like to know how long it will take you to make the repairs .
we would like that equipment reinstalled over here and checked when you &apos;re done .
good afternoon , governor .
if you and your party would come this way , i &apos;ll take you to the president &apos;s office .
he &apos;s waiting to receive you there .
i &apos;m please to meet you , sir .
i &apos;m here to assist you with anything you might need .
as you know , sir , we also have a parliamentary system of government similar to yours .
i will show you our business documents to help you conduct your audit .
i &apos;ve been asked to give you our accounting information , so that you can assist us in filling out our tax forms .
this file contains all receipts from sales listed in the general ledger , while this one contains customer information .
if you could tell me specifically what you would like to see for the audit , i &apos;ll take it out for you .
if there is anything else you need later , please call and we will bring it down to the city tax office .
good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
my name is kazuko hirano .
i &apos;ll be accompanying you on today &apos;s tour as your guide .
if you have any questions as we go along , please don &apos;t hesitate to ask .
the tour will start here in the head office , where we will visit the president &apos;s office and computer room .
when we finish , about one hour from now , we &apos;ll board a microbus in front of this gate and go to the obayashi plant , where most of our production is done .
we should be there for about two hours .
after that , we &apos;ll return here , a little before five o &apos;clock .
then , if you feel up to it , we &apos;d like to invite you to join us for dinner in the reception room .
this is our communications center .
that small computer terminal to your right keeps us in 24-hour a day contact with all our overseas branches and relays incoming messages to their correct locations .
delivering a ten-page letter to one of our domestic offices from anywhere in the would can be done in less than thirty seconds .
this is our communications chief , mr. watanabe .
he &apos;s such an expert on keeping everything running smoothly , the president says we couldn &apos;t function without him .
in regard to your question , i &apos;m not exactly sure myself , so let &apos;s ask mr. nishida if he can tell us .
well , this just about completes our itinerary for today .
do you have any questions ?
i hope you have all enjoyed your visit and come to see us again sometime .
if you do visit , be sure to ask for me by name , kazuko hirano , and i will be glad to help you any way i can .
while you are waiting , let me tell you about our facilities .
we have a newspaper rack over there and a number of magazines on this table .
however they are all written in japanese .
the restrooms are around the corner in the hallway .
you would probably like to freshen up after your trip , so let me show you where the washroom is .
i apologize i didn &apos;t warn you about the heavy rain we have at this time of year .
please give me your jacket and i &apos;ll dry it off for you while you &apos;re taking to mr. otake .
no , please , it &apos;s no trouble at all .
it sounds like you have a cold .
let me get you some medicine . it &apos;s good for colds or allergies .
oh dear , you &apos;ve got a cut on your hand .
let me get you some antiseptic medicine and bandages for that .
if it is alright with you , i &apos;ll translate what he said into english .
i can speak a little english . would you like me to translate that for you ?
mr. kaneda just made a joke about the condition of the factory .
he said it was unbelievable that a soap plant could be so dirty .
he is using an unusual northern dialect , which is why everyone is laughing .
it &apos;s difficult to translate that word directly into english , it &apos;s an expression we customarily use to start a meal .
it means something similar to &quot; let &apos;s have this &quot; .
let me paraphrase what he said like this ..
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not familiar with the term &quot; spandex &quot; .
since it seems important to this discussion , could you explain what it means before i translate what you said ?
you &apos;ll find a post office on the lefthand corner of the next street .
look for a red &quot; t &quot; with a bar over it .
the mailbox is also red .
would you like to know how to get there the fastest way or the easiest-to-remember way ?
i &apos;m not sure how to get there myself . but i think you could find out over there .
that red light means that is a police box .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;ll take you there myself .
it &apos;s not far but it &apos;s a little hard to find .
here you are . that &apos;s it across the street .
is there anything else i could help you with ?
let me draw you a simple may .
this arrow shows which direction is north .
before we start today &apos;s program . i would like to give you a general outline of our itinerary .
if you have any questions on the details as i go along , feel free to ask .
the ceremonies will begin at a quarter past nine with a song by our glee club .
after that , an opening address is scheduled to be given by the president .
a buffet lunch will be served at one o &apos;clock .
the afternoon will be used for committee meetings and special presentations .
any last minute schedule changes will be posted near the main entrance .
at the end of today &apos;s proceedings , a bus will be available to take you back to your hotel .
please follow me ; i &apos;ll guide you to the exit .
it was a great pleasure for me to meet you . please visit us again .
mr. furuta would like to express his gratitude that you could find the time to visit us today .
if you need any more information , do not hesitate to call on us again .
did you drive here today , or would you like me to call a taxi for you ?
a bus to the train station stops in front of the main gate three times an hour .
if you could wait for about ten minutes , mr. arita will give you a ride to the station .
may i help you , sir ?
good afternoon , mr. lynch . how are you today ?
hello , mr. hoover . how are you getting along these days ?

i &apos;m afraid mr. freeman can &apos;t see you today . he &apos;s now in the middle of a meeting .
would you like to write a note to him on the matter you wish to see him about ?
or do you want mr. freeman to call you back ?
mr. french would like to meet you , but he &apos;ll be busy until this afternoon .
do you have any free time after one o &apos;clock ?

mr. brown , i &apos;d like to introduce george miller .
mr. miller is a business associate of our company .

can we go to the bank on foot ?
oh , it &apos;s too far to walk there . we can take a bus .
is the bus stop close by ?
yeah , it &apos;s a block away down the street .
isn &apos;t fred &apos;s fault ?
no , i don &apos;t suppose he &apos;s to blame . our client made a mistake .
but he &apos;s equally responsible because he &apos;s not careful enough .
write down your name here in ink .
but i don &apos;t have a pen with me . may i use a pencil ?
i &apos;m afraid a pencil won &apos;t do .
wait a moment . i &apos;ll find one for you .
we &apos;ll spend at most two days in beijing .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to do all the business within two days .
a week would be better but we can &apos;t afford the time .
i &apos;m taking the two o &apos;clock train .
that &apos;s one of the best trains .
could we start at twelve ?
there &apos;s no need to start out that early . let &apos;s make it one o &apos;clock and we still leave half an hour &apos;s margin .
would you like some fruit juice ?
no , thank you . i prefer tea to fruit juice .
ok , here you are .
we &apos;re going to the movies after work . will you join us ?
i &apos;m very sorry i can &apos;t ?
why not ?
i have some business to attend to .
are you in favor of a business trip to switzerland ?
that is just what i have in mind .
when are you planning to go ?
how about july ?
we need to strengthen the ties with our partner there .
do you think i should turn down his offer ?
yes , it &apos;s the correct thing to do .
but we may not get another partner soon .
even so , we can &apos;t do business with him .
he &apos;s not reliable .
i wonder if you agree to my proposal .
i don &apos;t entirely agree with you .
can you tell me why ?
money problem .
if we get all the money from the bank , paying the interests would be a great burden .
well , that &apos;s the thing .
reckon it &apos;s all right to have maggie do it ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a bad idea at all .
i hope she likes it .
do you favor the idea of postponing the meeting ?
i sure do .
let &apos;s have it tomorrow then .
why not make it the day after tomorrow ? i &apos;m supposed to attend a conference tomorrow .
is the arrangement sensible ?
i think that &apos;s quite a good thing to do .
then i feel relieved .
do you favor my proposal ?
i think i would go along with it .
i &apos;ll report it to our manager .
would you mind telling me your position on the problem ?
i can see no reason to disapprove of establishing a computer center .
does that mean you &apos;ll agree to give us the money ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
he &apos;s talented designer , isn &apos;t he ?
he sure is .
the problem is that very few people really appreciate his work .
i &apos;ll strongly recommend his new design .
he &apos;s lucky to have you back him up .
do you like the new design ?
it &apos;s just the thing .
swell !
i &apos;m so happy you like it .
the next we should do is to carry it out .
can i assume the adjusted agenda meets with your approval ?
i must say i find it quite reasonable .
so i can make the following arrangements according to it ?
that &apos;s right .
i think we &apos;d better cancel tomorrow &apos;s meeting .
it &apos;s sensible idea , i think .
let &apos;s open the window . it &apos;s really stuffy in here .
you have a point there .
but you &apos;d better put on your coat . it &apos;s still cold .
thank you for telling me .
would you like a smoke ?
i &apos;ve quit smoking .
you &apos;re smart to quit smoking .
but i simply can &apos;t however i try .
we &apos;re to slow .
could we speed up a little ?
that &apos;s just what i &apos;m getting at .
dalian is a beautiful city !
it sure is .
no other city can match it . it &apos;s heaven !
well , if you live in other cities long enough , you &apos;ll love them just as much .
boxing is a brutal game , wouldn &apos;t you say so ?
i guess i would .
it &apos;s just too cruel .
yes , indeed .
cigarette production should be banned , wouldn &apos;t you agree ?
absolutely .
if no one produces them , people won &apos;t smoke . that &apos;s for sure .
you said it .
i think he &apos;s a promising young man .
i guess you &apos;re right .
maybe one day he &apos;ll become another bill gates .
let &apos;s wait and see .
i think modern painting means nothing .
i think so , too .
it &apos;s just pointless .
then why are so many guys so crazy abut it ?
either they &apos;re crazy or we can &apos;t understand art because we &apos;ve been engaged in business management too long .
the painting exhibition is worth visiting . do you agree ?
i suppose i do .
i &apos;ve got two tickets here . will you go with me at the weekend ?
sure , thank you .
don &apos;t you think that wives should obey their husbands ?
i suppose that &apos;s true , or there won &apos;t be peace at home .
but many people in the west don &apos;t think so .
frankly speaking , i like the traditional chinese or japanese family .
chinese children are too spoiled these days .
yes , i believe so .
we american parents are not so lenient as some of you .
i think it &apos;s time we took some strict measures .
as the old saying goes , &quot; spare the rod , spoil the child . &quot;
some of the employers are too hard on the employees .
yeah , i agree . but some employees need to be disciplined .
maybe you &apos;re right . but i think they should show respect for the employees .
a pickpocket took all my money !
don &apos;t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ?
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
in that case , there wouldn &apos;t be so much theft .
definitely .
i &apos;ve been promoted , john .
lucky old you .
but you really deserve it .
you &apos;ve been working very hard .
your speech is smashing .
oh , do you really think so ?
yeah . did it take you long to prepare it ?
i prepared it on my way to the meeting .
you look cool in your new shirt !
as a matter of fact , you lock very much yourself .
that was a very successful project .
thank you for saying so . it was our first project here .
i hope i can see more of your work .
we &apos;ll try our best .
that was quite a meeting !
i do appreciate your courage .
i thought your speech was excellent .
i &apos;m glad you think so .
it was really a challenge to speak before the general manager and members of the board .
but you made it !
i think your dress is beautiful .
it &apos;s very nice of you to say so .
my boyfriend chose it for me .
your boyfriend really has an eye for clothes .
i really like your work .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
but it would be better if you were more careful .
thank you for your advice .
hi , jack !
who &apos;s the girl you were walking with ?
my girlfriend .
she &apos;s really beautiful .
who &apos;s the little girl ?
my daughter
you have a very lovely daughter , mr. wang .
you &apos;ve done a great job , charles .
thanks for your compliment .
i &apos;ve been working hard at it .
where there &apos;s a will , there &apos;s a way .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen a better design !
oh , come on . no kidding !
i &apos;m serious . it &apos;s really superb .
it &apos;s one of the most attractive designs i &apos;ve ever seen .
how very nice of you to say so !
you &apos;re very talented indeed . i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll make a successful designer .
aren &apos;t these glasses beautiful ?
yes , they really are .
but they cost me a fortune .
if only i could have a pair .
i admire your courage . mike .
thank you , mr. wang .
you &apos;re the only one who dared admit mistakes .
is this hat yours , susan ?
yeah , i bought it last week .
you really have good taste . you look wonderful wearing it .
oh , i &apos;m flattered .
wow !
a new necklace !
it goes really well with your skin , betty .
i &apos;m really glad you think so .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
a wedding ceremony ?
you &apos;re kidding again !
your typing has improved tremendously , jack !
and you &apos;ve got no errors this time and you finished in almost no time .
i can hardly believe it !
my compliments on our memory .
it &apos;s very nice of you to say so .
how can you remember such a long telephone number after dialing it only once ?
if you dare report it , i &apos;ll kill you .
don &apos;t &apos; you dare !
just you try !
you &apos;ll regret making such a decision .
i &apos;ll never regret it .
you will . you wait and see1
i &apos;m sorry to tell you that i &apos;ll have to fire you .
just you try !
what a mess you &apos;ve made here !
i didn &apos;t mess it up .
just let me catch you it again !
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll have to report you to the boss .
what do you mean ?
you should know that i &apos;ve been trying to improve myself .
but it &apos;s still far from enough .
don &apos;t push me too far , or you &apos;ll be sorry .
get out of here !
you &apos;ve got no right to speak to me like that .
just don &apos;t let me see you again , that &apos;s all .
if you go on taking advantage of the lady , i &apos;ll fix you .
just try and see .
if you don &apos;t behave yourself , you &apos;ll be sued .
don &apos;t make a fuss over it .
stay away from her . she doesn &apos;t like you .
it &apos;s none of your business .
clear off !
you &apos;ll have to pay for that .
i would accept the condition if i were you , or he will let you go .
i &apos;d rather give up the job than work for that hooligan .
mark my words , i &apos;ll tell your boss if you don &apos;t keep out of trouble .
who cares ?
i don &apos;t really want to say this , but if you don &apos;t cooperate , we shall have to cancel the contract .
neither side will benefit from it then .
we &apos;ve got no other choice .
are they always so noisy ?
sorry , mr. smith . i &apos;m trying to make them quiet down .
i &apos;m afraid if the noise goes on , i shall have no alternative but to leave .
i just taught him a lesson . nothing more .
i think you &apos;ve carried it too far .
i &apos;m sorry . i slipped up there .
it doesn &apos;t matter . we &apos;re only discussing .
no one can be sure .
we should look at it from all angles .
i think that &apos;s nonsense . that &apos;s beside the point .
i put forward the proposal after careful consideration .
it has a lot to do with the topic .
i think we should begin our tour with the great bell temple . we can save a lot of time .
and the temple is very famous in china .
i &apos;ll take you up on that .
well , let &apos;s gather there at 8 sharp , ok ?
don &apos;t argue .
let &apos;s sit down and talk things over .
i think a loan is a must to solve the problem .
but i think we can raise money by ourselves .
i think i &apos;m at odds with you over the supply plan .
but it &apos;s already been approved by the loss .
then i &apos;ll have to talk to him right away .
i &apos;m going to apply for the job .
but i don &apos;t think you stand much of a chance .
we &apos;ll see .
pop music is really a bore .
i can &apos;t take your point completely .
most young people enjoy it .
simply because they &apos;re young .
we can follow their lead .
that &apos;s all .
we must with the pros and cons before we make a decision .
it &apos;s really a hard nut for us to crack .
yeah . let &apos;s put our heads together and see if we can do something .
i suggest we ask the engineer for help first .
it &apos;s very important for us to clarify the ownership .
i beg to differ with you on this matter . there won &apos;t be any problem with the ownership .
i think it &apos;s the price that should concern us .
i think production is the key to success of our company .
i &apos;m afraid i have a different opinion . i think management is the most important factor .
wal-mart is the most successful .
i think point is made clear without debate .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t agree with you on that . it &apos;s microsoft that represents the trend of modern business .
i think we can solve those difficult situations first .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t accept your opinion . we should do it step by step .
i &apos;m not convinced by your explanation .
which part ?
the whole of it .
could you explain it from beginning to end once again ?
it would seem that you &apos;re right .
but can you prove it with facts ?
facts are not available yet . but i think we &apos;ll find them sooner or later .
the distribution plan is up to the boss himself , i think .
i take issue with you on that .
the company belongs to everyone . all of us have a say .
you look unhappy .
i love my girlfriend but my parents disapprove of our marriage .
it &apos;s no use complaining .
you &apos;d better it over with your parents again .
all right , i &apos;ll try it again .
could you recommend a good restaurant ?
why not go to the white rose ?
that &apos;s my favorite place .
thank you . i &apos;ll take your advice .
what &apos;re you going to do next month ?
i &apos;ll go to france and work as an interpreter for the company .
be sure to have your picture taken in front of eiffel tower !
i &apos;m not on good terms with my boss .
don &apos;t be unhappy .
we need people in the marketing department . they way i see it , you should join us .
do you think i should join them ?
if i were in your shoes , i certainly would .
but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll take up too much my time .
i &apos;ve had a very good job offer , john .
i want to accept it .
ok if you like . but i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t .
you have a good future here .
i &apos;ve been working on the problem for a long time . but there &apos;s still no solution .
take it easy .
you might as well do something else now. maybe you can find some clues later .
you look very pale .
i &apos;ve got a bad headache .
i &apos;d suggest you go to see the doctor at once .
bob , why are you looking so depressed ?
i made a mistake .
if i tell the boss , i &apos;m afraid he won &apos;t forgive me . if i don &apos;t our company will suffer .
would it be a good idea to tell him the truth ?
john , you should take good care of yourself .
you &apos;re coughing these days . you have to cut down on smoking , if you listen to me .
do i need to carry out the plan now ?
no , you &apos;d better not .
could you offer me some advice ?
i recommend that you wait until next month .
i haven &apos;t seen you for ages . what have you been doing ?
i &apos;ve been tied up with my business .
it &apos;s sunday today . would you be interested in doing something outdoors ?
it &apos;s a nice day and we &apos;re free this afternoon .
what do you think we should do ?
how about going swimming ?
sounds like a good swimming ?
what do you make of the tax increase ?
the state will benefit a lot , i think .
what do people think of it ?
it &apos;s bard to say .
how do you find things over here ?
it &apos;s quite different from what i expected .
have you got used to the life ?
english is not your native tongue but you speak very good english .
how in your opinion can i improve my english ?
first of all , you must be interested in it . and then , you should make constant efforts .
don &apos;t you think that housework is very boring ?
no , on the contrary , i consider it to be a nice change after work .
maybe you &apos;re right .
what in your opinion can be done to stop people smoking ?
stop producing cigarettes .
but that &apos;ll influence the national economy .
that &apos;s right . but i think it &apos;s the best way .
how do you like this city ?
well , i must say it &apos;s pretty crowded .
and the traffic needs more control .
do you have any particular views on sexual discrimination ?
nothing particular .
from my point of view , women should have equal rights with men .
i &apos;m happy that we hold the same view .
what would you say to some lunch ?
so , let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s your reaction to his comment ?
it &apos;s unfair .
nobody likes it .
i wonder where he &apos;s coming from .
i &apos;d say you &apos;re very happy these days .
there &apos;s always a smile on your face . and you talk much more than before .
what &apos;s the reason ?
it &apos;s just that i got my article published in the newspaper .
as i see it , bob is not fit for the position .
i agree .
but remember he &apos;s the cousin of our boss .
yes , that is the reality .
i &apos;m quite sure that he failed .
how did you find out ?
he looked very disappointed when he read the notice .
too bad , he really worked hard .
i &apos;d be glad to have your view on my report , mr. brown .
well , i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s a bit longer than necessary .
then i &apos;ll try to shorten it . thank you .
from my point of view , women should stay at home .
your idea is completely out of date .
these days women have equal rights and equal opportunities .
what do you thank of jane &apos;s choice ?
it &apos;s my feeling that she &apos;s made the right decision .
but i think she should have thought it over .
she did and she decided to take the chance .
i &apos;m convinced that his plan is feasible .
but the problem is that we don &apos;t seem to have the capital needed .
i think we &apos;d better ask for a loan from the bank .
what &apos;s your opinion about boxing ?
form where i stand , it is brutal .
but i think it most enjoyable to watch .
maybe to some people .
it &apos;s necessary for me to understand the organization of our company first , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , i think so .
let &apos;s start from the top executive .
how is the company organized ?
the company consists of several interrelated departments.they &apos;re relatively independent , but each department has its own say .
who is at the top ?
the board of directors has the final say in all management matters .
who is the chairman ?
david burton .
who is directly responsible to the board ?
the general manager .
actually , he &apos;s the most powerful except for the board of directors .
is the general manager directly in charge of all the departments ?
each department has its manager .
can i have a list of the names of all the managers ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll get to know everybody soon .
the company is really well organized .
and it &apos;s very efficient .
everybody knows this job and only deals directly with one or two people .
how many departments are there in the company ?
there &apos;s six major departments : personnel , finance , production , marketing , public relations and administration .
which one is the largest department ?
the production department .
there &apos;re 500 people on the working staff in the department .
where can i get my salary ?
the finance department .
it &apos;s also in charge of income tax . if you &apos;re not clear about the taxes you should pay , you can also go and ask them for help .
the public relations department is very important .
yes , very important .
it helps to establish good relationships with other companies or institutions and to improve the image of the company .
which department do you think is the most important ?
relatively speaking , the production department .
without good products , there will be no profit at all .
your office is on the sixteenth floor , room 1611 , mr. smith .
it &apos;s big and bright .
shall we go and have a look ?
here we are , room 1611 .
it &apos;s nice , spacious and clean !
i &apos;m glad you like it .
if i want to make a phone call to other companies , can i call directly ?
no , it &apos;s an interphone system.you &apos;ll have to dial 0 first .
what if i need a larger room for a meeting ?
the meeting-room next door can hold about fifty people .
it seems that the office is well equipped with modern facilities .
this partly accounts for the efficiency of the company .
this is a dictating machine .
i see .
there &apos;s also a remote dictating machine , which is small and portable .
there is a fax machine on your desk . it &apos;s very convenient if you want to send some copies of urgent documents to the clients .
that &apos;s good . it &apos;ll save a lot of time .
can i surf the internet with this computer here ?
network is omnipresent nowadays .
it &apos;s indispensable to modern business .
in the drawer , there &apos;re some office staples : paper clips , a stapler , paper glue , correction fluid , etc .
everything i need is within reach .
yes ?
it &apos;s used for recording letters onto magnetic tape for transcription by a secretary .
secretaries don &apos;t have to take dictation directly.they &apos;re simply given a tape to transcribe when it &apos;s convenient .
hey , you also have a telex machine here !
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s available day and night . it &apos;s inexpensive and easy to use .
there &apos;s also a hole punch to make holes in paper .
where is it ?
here , in the drawer ?
who is my secretary ?
lee ping .
she &apos;s very competent and industrious .
do i have a personal assistant ?
yes.her name is helen wright.she speaks very good chinese .
it will be convenient when i contact chinese clients or customers .
would you please introduce the clerks in my department to me ?
they &apos;re paul cummins and michael stott .
paul is from england , a very humorous guy.michael comes from sweden , a very responsible person .
i presume that everybody here has got experience of working in a joint venture .
yes.they have been working here for at least one year .
i believe i will have a good time working with them .
surely you will .
i want to change my plan .
do you mean to quit this project ?
and i want to start preparing for a more important one .
are you going to tell him ?
the secret will not be a secret any more then .
what are you going to do tomorrow ?
i &apos;ve no idea .
why not go shopping with me ?
have you decided to take that job ?
i &apos;d like to hear your opinion .
why not go in to the joint venture ?
the salary there is much higher .
what &apos;re you doing at the weekend ?
nothing particular .
how about going boating with us ?
that would be nice but .
oh , come on .
travelling is boring , i think .
what &apos;s your intention then ?
to stay at home .
what a lazy girl !
do you have any intention of going to paris to learn painting ?
yes , it &apos;s my dream .
i &apos;m glad to tell you it &apos;s going to come true now .
there &apos;s a chance to go to hong kong .
who will be the lucky bird ?
i mean you to go .
i simply can &apos;t believe my ears !
a hot film is on .
i expect i &apos;ll see it tomorrow .
what about today ?
i &apos;ve got two tickets .
you &apos;re very kind .
excuse me , i &apos;m thinking of buying a red car .
how about a white one ?
no , i don &apos;t like white .
will you tell me your decision ?
yes , i &apos;ve decided not to go abroad .
why ?
that &apos;s a chance many people dream of .
i &apos;m badly needed in the project , you know .
i &apos;m planning to go for a swim .
i didn &apos;t think you liked swimming .
no , i don &apos;t. but the doctor says i can lose weight that way .
that &apos;s good news for me . we can go together then .
i plan to go abroad .
look before you leap .
it &apos;s not easy to live in a strange country .
i know . but i want to see more while i &apos;m young .
i have no intention of refusing to help you .
but you don &apos;t seem very enthusiastic .
sorry , i &apos;m just tired .
i intend to find a new job .
i want to make more money .
don &apos;t you feel it &apos;s suffocating here ?
is your intention to quit the job ?
i &apos;m sorry to say it is .
i propose we start at once .
why don &apos;t you wait for a few more days ?
it &apos;s very urgent .
helen , could you tell me what the problem is ?
well , it &apos;s just that i &apos;m expected to do so much extra work .
would you like to speak with mr. wang ?
how is your report ?
almost finished .
i &apos;ve been working around the clock .
is there anyway i can help ?
yes , i want to know the latest information about our project .
it &apos;s almost finished.alice is writing a report about it .
how long will it take them to get the project done ?
i think you are behind schedule.our client is arriving today .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure they can work it out .
what do you suggest ?
we are scheduled to meet mr. lee this afternoon .
but we haven &apos;t finished our preparation yet .
well , i &apos;ll get tim to give you a hand .
mr. wang , we are going to try an open plan .
does that mean we &apos;ll share an office with our boss ?
not exactly .
but i &apos;m sure we will have to share one room with more people .
well , i suppose it &apos;s time we got back to work now .
what did i come in for ?
you want to find the file on abb .
wang , i can &apos;t find the document on abb .
it can &apos;t be true .
i &apos;m certain you &apos;ve placed the document on file .
let me see . oh , here it is .
i can &apos;t find our manager .
could you ask for sick leave for me ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
i &apos;ve got a fever . i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t attend the meeting .
i don &apos;t know . i have to see the doctor .
this is wang li speaking .
could i speak to mr. brown ?
yes , speaking .
well , i want to tell you i won &apos;t be in today .
i &apos;m sick and my doctor wants me to rest for a few days .
sorry to hear that .
have a good rest .
do you think you &apos;ll be back next week ?
i hope so .
i &apos;ll let you know if i can &apos;t .
hope you recover soon .
i &apos;m planning to have two weeks &apos; off in may .
you mean you want to use your vacation days for this year ?
yes , i want to see my parents .
morning , mr. brown .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about my vacation .
mr. brown , could you spare a few minutes ?
i want to have a word with you .
i &apos;m afraid i have to be off work tomorrow .
to attend my brother &apos;s wedding ceremony .
have a great time .
remember to ask john to cover your work .
mr. raphael would like to invite you to have dinner with him at the international hotel this saturday .
we &apos;re having some special customers like you for dinner on the 20th . i hope you won &apos;t be engaged as last time . the party wouldn &apos;t be complete without you .
come at seven , mr. hawkins .
there &apos;ll be dancing till 11 o &apos;clock , and a buffet supper after that . i hope you can make it .

of course , i &apos;ll be present at your celebration .
thanks . i &apos;ll be delighted to come , but will you repeat the time and the place , please ?
terrific !
nothing can prevent me from visiting your modern assembly line .
i accepted another invitation for that day , so i can &apos;t come .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;ll be tied up then .
i &apos;m terribly sorry i &apos;ll be completely snowed under this friday .
what a bad luck !

mr. chairman , members of the association :
thank you for your warm welcome . it is good to be able to be here today and speak before you group .
i am a lawyer , and i spend a lot of my time now with lawyers , who are generally fine people , but to spend time with farmers again is a little like coming home .
i feel very comfortable in a group like this , with people like yourselves .
i spent a lot of my younger years on my family &apos;s farm , so farming is in my blood.you can put me in a suit and stick me in an office in well town , but you can &apos;t change my heart , and my heart is with land and the people .
and that &apos;s a big reason for my decision to run for a legislative seat .
i see problems in this country that aren &apos;t being addressed by our officials , who seem more interested in putting on a show for the television cameras than doing their work , sometimes.our traditional society is changing and our country needs new , young leaders among the people to ensure that these changes are for the best of all .
i am especially concerned that these changes don &apos;t leave the farmer with the short end of the stick .
farmer &apos;s problems are what i &apos;ve come too talk with you about today.the more i study the situation in our society , the more i realize how complex the problems are , and how important is the need for cooperation and determination to achieve our goals .
if you are looking for someone to tell you that the answers to your problems are simple and that future is nothing but roses , then i &apos;m not your man .
i don &apos;t see any simples answers , and i feel that it will take a lot of hard work to keep our future prospects realistic.and the future is going to require the farmer , as we all segments of our society , to change in order to meet the challenges .
i think the main problems facing farmers today are competition for land , maintenance of long term productivity and soil conservation , the opening of domestic markets to foreign producers , and the future of government subsides and price stabilization programs .
i &apos;d like to talk briefly about these problems now , and during the question and answer session , i &apos;ll elaborate further on each point .
competition for lands is becoming more serious in our country . we have to accept the need of cities and industry to expand onto traditional farming lands . however , we must set limits on this expansion and establish fair compensation guidelines to use when land is appropriated . soil conservation practices must begin to be implemented as a routine matter . the government must help the farmer by sponsoring research and encouraging proper cultivation techniques . the opening of the domestic agricultural markets to foreign producers has been an unfortunate consequence of the trade imbalance in the industrial sector . farmers are being penalized for industry &apos;s exports . government subsidies and price stabilization programs should be subject to a systematic and periodic review to ensure that the programs are really helping the farmer and not just allowing a few to get rich without producing anything . if a program is not functioning properly , then those financial resources questions now for me , so i &apos;ll conclude my speech and we can begin a substantive discussion .
thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak before you today . i hope you will decide to support my candidacy for office . i need your help now , and when i &apos;m elected , you can count on my support for the farmer .
thank you very much for your time today , it can change our future tomorrow .
mr. mayor , members of the government , ladies and gentlemen :
our coming together today signifies the start of an important project &apos;s construction phase of taipei . i want to welcome you to the ground breaking ceremony for the new headquarters of the taipei railway administration and the taipei train and subway station , located here in central taipei .
this project brings under one roof all the heads of the departments in the taipei railway administration and their staff.they will occupy the third to the sixth floors.the seventh floor will house the new computer facilities.the first and second floors will be the train and subway station , while the three subterranean floors will be the platforms and maintenance areas .
this project has been in the planning stages for more than five years and represents a collective effort by all level of government . its importance has enabled this project to avoid much of the political infighting and posturing which has plagued other projects .
when we examine this project closely , we can safely conclude that it is a sure thing that the people will benefit from this project .
the benefits of the project are many .
first , the consolidation of all administrative functions under one roof will greatly increase the efficiency of managing the railway system .
a lot of duplicity that was necessary when the various offices were scattered around taipei can be eliminated .
the installation and use of the new computer facilities will allow better understanding of the rail system and allow maximum use of the resources available to the railway administration .
the completion of this building in two years will coincide with the completing of the underground rail system in the greater taipei area.the underground rail system will eliminate above ground rail lines plus several important trunk lines in the metropolitan area.the increased use of the rail system by computers once the new rail lines are operating , will greatly ease the pressures of surface traffic and help alleviate some of the air and noise pollution caused by private vehicles .
in summary , this project &apos;s completion will mean better rail service , plus faster government of passengers and freight , all at lower cost to the government , with a cleaner government for the residents of taipei .
today , let us together turn the first shovelful of earth and in two years together we can dedicate the new taipei train and subway station and taipei railway administration building .
mr. chairman , ladies and gentlemen :
i really don &apos;t know what to say except &quot; thank you &quot; .when i was invited here tonight , i had no idea that this was going to happen , so i haven &apos;t prepared anything to say .
when i recall others others who have accepted this award in the past , i feel quite undeserving .
i &apos;ve know for some time of this organization &apos;s charitable deeds and progressive ideas and i feel it is an honor to be selected to receive this award . i feel very lucky because i really enjoy my work , even though sometimes it is hard , and sometimes i think of giving it up for something easier.at times you think that you &apos;ve seen it all by now , only to be confronted with a family &apos;s situation that is worse than you ever imagined possible.but then i see a sparkle in an old man &apos;s tired eyes , i feel people &apos;s hearts changing , opening up again and i know this is where i must be , and this is the work i must be doing .
so many times i &apos;ve seen that last little sparkle of humanity left in a person catch hold rekindle a flame that burns brighter than ever.this i count as my real reward .
there are so many others more deserving of this award . i work with dozens of people who see the same conditions .
i think the children &apos;s division is providing some excellent resources to very needy people.the people working the elderly must really be thanked also for all they do .
i must thank my wonderful family for their support and encouragement .
my husband is a wonderful man who helps in so many ways .
my children are continual source of love and inspiration .
i only wish i had more time to be with them .
my church also plays an important role in strengthening our family ties and providing me with a faith to carry on through all the trials that life presents to me .
on behalf of all my co-workers and my family i &apos;ll just say thank you for this award , which symbolizes your own concern for the less fortunate and disadvantaged in our society.thank you .
ladies and gentlemen :
today &apos;s meeting will be a most memorable occasion for me , because it is my time to thank everyone for their support and encouragement in the past year during my tenure as president of this group .
serving as your president gave me the opportunity to work with everyone here , and i count that one of the greatest personal rewards i received during the last year .
i remember how , at first , i was unsure of my ability to function effectively as your president , but now , with every member &apos;s unselfish contribution to our work here , the job became a joy to me .
our successes this year are a direct result of the active participation of all the members in our group .
i am especially proud of the success of this year &apos;s arbor day fund drive . ms. lin qiu-lan , as chairperson of the tree sales committee was directly responsible for the highest sales ever recorded during this activity.as a result , we are able to carry on some of our most important projects , and thousands of trees were distributed to taipei residents of trees were distributed to taipei residents for planting , thus contributing to the beautification of our city for years to come .
also , i must give the credit to ms. chiang for organizing some of the most memorable and interesting programs for each of our monthly meetings and her programs for each of our monthly meetings , and her programs provided much useful information about local plants and flowers , about producing better gardens , and many other topics .
with your continuing support in the coming year , ms. juliet , our new president , can carry on our important work of beautifying our homes and our city .
some unfinished complete next year .
i am thinking particularly of the project for developing a small downtown park .
for giving me the opportunity to serve as president , to serve our city , and to work with everyone here , i give my sincere thanks to you.this has been a most memorable year or me and i hope our group continues to grow and prospers in the future.thank you .
ladies and gentlemen :
it &apos;s with great pleasure that i welcome you here today to the first anniversary celebration of the founding of the magazine nature .
never could we have imagined a year ago that we would have come so far in so short a time.but here we are at the end of year one , and what a fantastic year it has been.let me review our achievements in the first year .
we &apos;ve published twelve very impressive pieces of literature , each moth somehow surpassing the quality and depth of the previous month &apos;s edition .
our creative and talented staff won two writing awards and two photographic awards in this short time.also , the popularity of the magazine has far exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts of our marketing staff .
and i feel that the acceptance of our magazine by people is the most rewarding aspect of this project .
i can remember about two years ago when there was only a small group of four people.we had an idea for a nature-oriented magazine , but we all had doubts about the general acceptance of the idea , whether there would be enough interest from people to sustain us during the early development stage.we assembled the finest people we could find and decided , from the start , to produce the highest quality product as possible we would .
today , it &apos;s a wonderful feeling to know that we have succeeded , and everyone here shares the credit for making this magazine what it has become .
this is a special group of people and i &apos;m proud to be a part of what you have helped create.walking among you today , talking and listening , i am struck at the feeling of excitement i can sense in the new ideas and directions i hear being discussed .
while it is a formidable task for us all , i know that we are going to make the next year an even more successful venture , and i &apos;m sure that next year at this time we &apos;ll have more awards , and more subscribers , and feel an even greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment .
congratulations on our great success this year and good luck for continued success in our second year .
ladies and gentlemen :
would you believe it if i said that there is a large group of workers in taiwan who are largely being ignored by the business community here ? workers who are able , reliable , and conscientious , workers , who , if given the most dependable , loyal employees .
as a group , this organization represents a large proportion of taiwan &apos;s business leaders-men and women who have climbed the &quot; ladder of success &quot; and &quot; know the ropes &quot; . i appreciate this opportunity to address such an important group , and hope my words will prove of some benefit to you .
you will certainly benefit in your respective companies by hiring the disabled or handicapped persons.a disabled person undeniably has some physical limitations-maybe this person is confined to a wheelchair , maybe that person has to use crutches to move around , maybe another doesn &apos;t have full use of one or both of his arms.but whatever physical handicap confronts the disabled worker , you rest assured , it is overcome by development in other areas .
please don &apos;t misunderstand my meaning here tonight.disabled persons aren &apos;t looking for charity , for a handout.they are looking for opportunity , for an alternative to not even being considered for regular employment .
a few examples might make this clearer .
john smith had polio as a child and has great trouble moving around , even on crutches.but that didn &apos;t stop john from forming and managing a very successful computer software company.part of john &apos;s successful formula is using several &quot; disabled &quot; employees who form the backbone of his research and development section.mary liu , denied entrance to taiwan &apos;s university system because a car accident left her confined to a wheelchair , is presently in an honor &apos;s master &apos;s program at a large california graduate school , studying business management.robert david works as a secretary for a large trading company and greatly impressed his superiors with this efficiency and industriousness .
these are certainly special people , but they aren &apos;t unique.there are many others like them who , given the chance , will prove that they too are special .
next time , a disabled person is applying for a job at your company , take the time to consider this person seriously .
i know that you will not be disappointed in your choice of a disabled person to fill the job after all , we are all human .
thank you for your time tonight .
ladies and gentlemen :
tonight i &apos;d like to speak on a very important , yet uncomfortable subject.a situation exists in the world right now that is so terrible , so inhumane , that i think you will agree that we must respond .
as i look out over the faces here , i see many friends , people i &apos;ve know for years , people i know who have good hearts and want the best for others as well as for themselves and their families.that &apos;s why i &apos;m speaking in front of this group . i know that you will respond to this urgent plea for help .
as you finish the last of your dessert here tonight , after a wonderfully prepared meal , it is hard to imagine being hungry , to imagine not having had a good meal today , for a few days , for a few weeks.but there are millions of people in the world today who are in just this situation , people who are literally starving to death in a most painful and pathetic way .
in particular , the world &apos;s attention has been fixed on the people of somalia - hundreds of thousands of people living at the edge of starvation and death , victims of circumstances beyond their control .
a capricious climate which has led to many years of drought , coupled with a practice of overusing the land resources , has made the land useless for growing crops or grazing animals.and if this were not enough , this region of africa is torn by civil war and strife , forcing these defenseless and starving people to escape periodic fighting .
when we see pictures of these emaciated beings : staving mothers with starving babies , children with bloated stomachs , and we &apos;ve all seen them , i think our first reaction is to turn away because it &apos;s too painful to confront this reality.but we must be stronger the page , there is no escape , and with this in mind , we begin to realize the depth of their and the need for action on our par .
but what can we really do ?
how can we really help these people ?
i &apos;ve studied this question over the past few months , and investigated all the organizations which , in one way or another , are connected to the relief effort in somalia . i &apos;ve discovered that there to is a great difference in the effectiveness of the various groups working with this problem , and i &apos;d like to describe the organization i think we should support .
this organization is a private group started by individuals , much like yourselves , who have seen this situation and want to help .
very little money donated to this group goes to administrative costs , as most of these functions are performed by volunteers.the aid provided is given to those most in need-none is funneled through the government.the types of aid provided are designed to meet different needs.foodstuffs are sent to some of the most needy refugee center for direct distribution.tools and training in better farming methods are being distributed in three pilot projects , initiated by this group.also this group is trying to focus international attention on the leaders of the warring factions to try to pressure them into negotiating a settlement and thus bring about a long sought after and much needed peace to the region .
this group is relatively small and needs financial and volunteer support from people worldwide to meet the challenges of this problem .
i know all of you want to help with this problem in somalia and i feel this direction will be most effective .
i have prepared some information packets about this problem and about this organization that i will gladly pass out to interested parties after the meeting . i think this is a good way to help our fellow human beings.who are in a very dangerous and hopeless situation .
thank you for your time tonight and thank you for the help , i know that will be forthcoming .
ladies and gentlemen :
on behalf of the fund raising committee , i &apos;d like to announce our decision to sponsor a run , which we &apos;ve named the dog trot . it will be a 5-kilometer foot race around the buildings in downtown taipei late september .
running is a great way to get into shape for you and your dog.as there are nearly two months before the race , everyone has plenty of time to practice .
not only will there be a wards for the fastest men , women and children in each age division , but there will also be many door prizes to be given away to lucky participants of the race .
ed brown is soliciting donations from local businesses for door prizes and i understand these will include some free veterinarian services , as well as free dinners at some fine restaurants , plus lots of other surprises.at the race , we will also have water and fruit for the runners .
everyone is needed to help on this project-because of its importance in telling people about our society and the work we are trying to do , plus raising money for our other activities.and there is much tot be done to prepare for it.susan jones is in charge of the race itself and will need up to 15 people on race day to help with registration , and crowd and traffic control.rich ashton will man the information booth at the race and says he will need one or two people on the day of the race plus two people with artistic skills to help in him design the booth over the next few weeks . i am in charge of promotion and i have 2000 fliers that need to be posted around town where many people can see them .
so there is a lot of work to be done , but we feel it will be a good way to focus attention on the humane , plus a fun way to raise money for our work .
the race is scheduled for sunday , september 24th , at 6 : 30 in the morning.the start and finish lines will be at the front gate of chung shin memorial on chung shan south road .
we need everyone &apos;s support for this , so think about what you can contribute and after tonight &apos;s meeting is adjourned , come to this table to sign up for the various tasks and also take home a handful of fliers to pass out at your work , school and neighborhood .
your participation will guarantee a successful race.thank you .

ladies and gentlemen :
today opens the second international conference on the greenhouse effect and global warming .
the importance of this issue is evidenced by the participation of united nations and government representatives , scientists , academics , industry personnel , and representatives of native tribal groups from all over the world .
global warming is with us now , the trends of atmosphere will lead to a partial melting of the polar ice caps which will raise the polar ice caps which will raise the level of the oceans by as much as few meters , inundating the homes of an estimated one billion people .
the warming trend will play havoc with the world &apos;s climate , changing and expanding the location and extent of the world &apos;s deserts , altering weather patterns in the major food producing areas-leading to possible patterns starvation .
warmer air and ocean temperatures will spawn a new generation of super hurricanes.and there will other as yet unforeseen catastrophes .
our task is to understand the meaning of this and prepare some concrete steps to be taken .
our focus over the nest few days will , first , be a complete review of all recent and current research results concerned with the phenomena of global warming .
a serious effort will the made to synthesize this massive amount of information into a coherent , easily understandable summary , and to understand and resolve together to work through the many hurdles that lay in our way .
this group has the potential to help launch a far-reaching effort to alter man &apos;s idea of his world and to alleviate his adverse effects on it .
we are optimistic that this conference is an important beginning step in the right direction.we hope by the week &apos;s end to find all of you eager to return to your homes , families , and jobs ready to continue the struggle for the earth &apos;s survival .
thank you for coming .
welcome to the annual meeting of the sales representatives of close weave textiles .
as president of this company , i would like to say a few words to open this weekend concerning your role in the company , and also some thoughts about being a salesman.our agenda for the weekend is designed to fully acquaint you with our new line of products and new manufacturing techniques and delivered by the best of our research team , plus provides some helpful suggestions and proved strategies for better selling from some veterans on our staff .
the sales department represents on of the most vital links of our company with other industries and buyers .
our record sales for the last two years are a direct result of your hard work and dedication , and i know that this trend will continue for many years.your record is even more remarkable , given some of the disturbances in the local scene from time to time and the often confusing international trade picture .
in preparing my remarks for tonight , i began to reflect on one of the finest people i &apos;ve ever know and one of the most successful salesman ever to work here.only the ones of us who have been around for a long time will remember mr. johnson smith . i think this man &apos;s remarkable success can be attributed to some important ideas.first , mr. smith &apos;s perseverance was amazing.he would work all the angles , he would strive to understand the buyer &apos;s needs in great detail and offer them exactly what they were seeking his personal attention and interest showed that this concern was for their welfare and satisfaction , not just making a sale .
his knowledge of his product lines and its manufacturing processes was unsurpassed by anyone else in the business .
he had a quick , sharp mind , but mostly the intensely studied his markets.he would read all he could get about the particular field he was working in at the moment .
over the years , this pursuit of knowledge led to an understanding of all levels of the manufacturing processes in many diverse industries .
more than this , though , he possessed an understanding of the human spirit.he know about all the current events and would speak with authority on the important issues in the news , not as one armed with a lot of facts , but as one who was in love with life .
i think the most important parts of being a successful salesman are meeting your customers &apos; needs first , having a complete knowledge of the business you are working in , and treating your customers as friends first , and business associates second .
as you think of your own business dealings , perhaps these suggestions could prove fruitful if you incorporate them into your program . i which you all the success in the world and hope that we can repeat our record-setting sales for another year .

ladies and gentlemen :
we are all saddened by the recent passing of george stephenson.at tonight &apos;s meeting , i want to take time out to remember this great man and his contributions to this organization and to our entire society .
mr. stephenson was a leader in both business and government in our city .
as the president of lawton textiles , he turned that company into a very successful enterprise whose business connection now span the globe .
his leading role in the formation of the american textile market greatly benefited the entire domestic textile industry.his international prestige was utilized by the government in last year &apos;s trade negotiations with the european community &apos;s textile importers for america to secure continuing share of that market .
mr. stephenson was a long-standing member of this organization who served unselfishly for over twenty years.he served as the secretary for a total of four years , as vice-president for two years in a row , and as president for a total of three years .
his chairmanship of many committees and active participation in many others is a testament to his devotion to the goals of this organization .
in talking with many of you over the past few days . i am struck by to feelings .
first , everyone spoke of the great enthusiasm which characterized mr. stephenson &apos;s work .
he was never too busy to help a friend.his door was always open to listen to a co-worker &apos;s needs and advice.also , mr. stephenson always seemed able to motivate the good parts of one &apos;s personality .
may times he extended a helpful hand to a troubled young person , offered an opportunity for being out of the trouble , and somehow always stimulated that young person to turn their life around and leave their troubled times behind.his faith in the basic goodness of the human spirit will be a lasting inspiration to us all .
mr. stephenson and his service to this organization and to our society will be remembered by all .
we have surely lost a valuable and irreplaceable friend and associate.may his memory serve as an inspiration for us to continue his good works .
ladies and gentlemen :
i have the pleasure , now , of announcing the recipient of the humanitarian service award , which we present once a year to an individual whose contributions to bettering the lives of our citizens are particularly outstanding .
while this is only a symbolic gesture , it is hoped that the work that people are engaged in will be highlighted by this award .
two months ago , our committee asked level of possible recipients who have exhibited a special level the of commitment and courage in our struggle to better the condition of our people .
our committee carefully investigated the names it received , and as there were several people who had done much in the past few years , the selection of just one of them was difficult.however , we have selected a most deserving person .
our award goes to a woman who has been a tower of strength to all who are around her.as a government social worker , she helps the very poorest families try to get on their feet.she visits the homes of her clients , discusses their situation and problems , and works to resolve the worst problems , so that some of the family members can begin to work outside the home to support the family .
in cases where people are incapable of working , she arranges for the appropriate agencies to provide for the families .
it &apos;s a difficult job to face , day after day , visiting the poorest , most neglected people in our society.but this remarkable woman does this and more .
in researching her accomplishments , our committee talked to many of the people she has helped over the years and they all speak of her understanding and compassion , of her strength and spirit which many said have them a feeling of hope , something they had abandoned .
her coworkers hold her in the highest regards and marvel at her energy and devotion to her work .
in addition to her work , she and her husband are raising two daughters.she is active in a local church and also participates in activities at her daughter &apos;s school .
so please join with me in congratulation this year &apos;s recipient of our humanitarian service award , susan wang .
ms.wang , would you please come forward to receive your award ?
ladies and gentlemen :
a problem has surfaced recently between the us and h government concerning the lack of protection of intellectual property and the failure to observe copyright laws in this country , as h government strives to become more active in international affairs on an equal footing with other nations , it must begin to pay more attention to generally recognized conventions such as copyright laws .
copyright laws protect an idea , a product , or a publication from use by unauthorized people for a specified length of time , usually several years.people can only use copyrighted material if they obtain permission from the holders of the copyright .
often , a fee is charged or the privilege of using copyrighted material .
man companies invest large amounts of money in research to develop new ideas and products.these new ideas allow the company to have a competitive advantage over others in the same industry.these advantages mean a more attractive product to sell , or some new innovation which changes the face of the whole industry , as in the compact disc boom of recent years.the company may also choose to sell the copyrighted information to other companies for large sums of money .
h government has largely ignored international copyright laws until very recently , when it has experienced external pressure to conform to these laws.by ignoring their laws , manufacturers could immediately incorporate new ideas and designs into their products without spending the money on research , thus allowing them to stay competitive with foreign companies .
are copyright laws a good idea after all ?
some people argue that the protection of new ideas and products shows down further developments.the race for an aids treatment or vaccine , and the push to proved cold nuclear fusion are good examples to illustrate this criticism .
perhaps , better , more effective medicines could be developed more quickly if all the different pharmaceutical companies weren &apos;t competing against each other , and instead were working together .
likewise , it seems that most researchers aren &apos;t interested in how cold nuclear fusion will benefit mankind , but only in how it will benefit their schools or companies financially , or their own careers .
there are also claims that copyright laws are used to restrict access of developing countries to new technology they need to build their industries and stay competitive with the developed countries . by contrast , i think it could be argued that the computer industry has greatly benefited from a more relaxed exchange of new ideas and innovations , allowing the industry to move forward as a whole more rapidly than it otherwise might have .
certainly the lure of large profits from new ideas and new products are a driving force bdhind research today.the copyright laws are a part of the way business is done and , as such , must be respected by the members of the international community.perhaps , one way to get around the system in this country , is for the government to sponsor research in important fields , and then make new developments available to all in the industry who could use it.the country as a whole benefit from such an arrangement .
i &apos;m sure the government will recognize the importance of adherence to the international copyright agreements , and will work with us in policing h for violators.this will encourage innovative developments at home , allow you to shed the copycat image and assume the more appropriate role of a leader in the world community .
that &apos;s true .
sure , thank you .
i &apos;m afraid so .
you &apos;re right .
oh , that &apos;s great !
that &apos;s true .
oh , that &apos;s wonderful .
oh , great !
there is one thing worth mentioning at least .
certainly .
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
that &apos;s true .
pretty good .
am i right ?

the tenor luciano pavarotti , who was born in modena , italy , and lives there with his family , recently celebrated 25 years in opera , and he continues to grow and enrich the medium .
each season he regularly adds a new role to his repertoire , either for the stage or on records , as well as new songs to his recitals .
he has given performances in the great music halls of the world and his success encompasses concerts , television , recordings and films .
yet pavarotti also makes time for aspiring artists .
in addition to his master classes , he has organized an on-going international vocal competition with the opera company of philadelphia , appearing in performances with the winners .
the parents of victor hugo &apos;s sweetheart disapproved of the young author and forbade their daughter his company . even his mail was stopped and the pair were at their wits &apos; ends .
but hugo was not to be outdone . he got busy on a novel and , spurred by love , completed it in record time .
the novel was sold and , as goes without saying , was read by the girl and her parents .
the plot was hugo &apos;s sad plight and the parents &apos; despicable attitude .
after that he saw her .
when samuel johnson first met mrs. porter , who later became his wife , he was taking pains to impress upon her the fact that socially he was nothing to boast about .
to drive the point home , he said he had &quot; no social standing , no money and had one uncle who had been hanged . &quot;
mrs. porter , not to be outdone , replied , &quot; and i , sir , have no standing , no money , and while there are none of my relatives who have been hanged , i have at least fifty who deserve hanging . &quot;
for years i had wondered what the last day would be like .
in jan.1976 after two decades in the top echelons of the british security service , mi5 , it was time to rejoin the real world .
i was determined to make a new life for myself breeding horses out in australia .
i went back to my office to sort out my safe .
i turned the dials on the lock and swung open the heavy safe door .
in front was a mass of registry files stamped top secret , and behind them a neat stack of small combination boxes .
the remaining boxes held papers gathered after i joined the counterespionage department in 1964 , when the search for spies in british intelligence was at its most intense .
one of hong kong &apos;s best known couples , brenda and kai-bong chau tell of their most romantic valentines &apos; gifts to each other .
it was back in the &apos; 60s , in the early days of their courtship when brenda was at a convent school in england and kai-bong was studying at cambridge university .
owing to student penury kai-bong could only afford a string of fake pearls , but he presented them in a heart-shaped chocolate box on a heart-shaped velvet cushion he had specially made up .
brenda , in turn , painstakingly knit kai-bong a black sweater with his initials in white .
brenda &apos;s knitting skills were none too advanced , however , and the jumper turned out somewhat ill-fitting .
it was treasured nonetheless , and the chaus still have it to this day .
reversal of fortune , starring jeremy irons and glenn close , is based on one of the most notorious murder trials of the last decade .
sunny von bulow , a high society heiress , lies even today in an irreversible coma .
did her european aristocrat husband ; claus von bulow , inject her with insulin , inducing coma ?
was he a maniacal murderer or was she a drug-ridden neurotic woman who attempted suicide ?
this dramatic film attempts to reconstruct the bizarre real-life drama .
based on the book by alan dershawitz , claus von bulow &apos;s de fence lawyer and a noted human rights attorney , the film does not give any answers but it does get you thinking and forming your own conclusions .
produced by oliver stone , who won oscars for platoon and born on the 4th of july , it is an enthralling film , with excellent performances .
when caroline moved to her present job , she really thought she was starting to go places in her chosen career of public relations for a major financial institution .
she became manager of her own small department , with a team of two and a secretary , had a hectic round of foreign travel to fit into her busy schedule and felt she was heading in a clear direction .
three years later , she &apos;s in exactly the same job , the travel has become a bit exhausting , and the chances of promotion never seem to come her way .
her glittering career now has a decidedly tarnished feel about it and she seems to be stuck .
when she looks elsewhere , she appears to have out priced herself and what &apos;s , on offer either pays less , offers less of a challenge , or both .
jane is a very successful deputy manager in advertising sales of a magazine publisher .
she has worked hard to get where she is today , but now she feels she has run out of steam .
making that next move up the ladder just seems a bit too much like hard work and , after all , she has a nice job and life style already .
her confidence in her ability to move on has hit an all-time low .
if what these women are going through strikes a chord with you , you &apos;re experiencing a common phenomenon-you &apos;ve hit a career block .
and while there &apos;s little comfort in knowing others are in the same situation , looking at similar cases can help you to identify some crucial factors that may be holding you back , too .

as you know , my surname is sun , which is spelt exactly like the english word &quot; sun &quot; .
this causes me some trouble during my trip to england , as you will see later on .
before the journey , i have to go to the british consul &apos;s office for a visa .
when an english man asks you about your health , he is probably only doing so out of politeness .
unless he knows you have been ill , he is certainly not expecting a detailed medical report , and will be most surprised if you give him one .
cigarettes are rather expensive in the u.k. as they carry a heavy tax .
it is therefore a good idea to buy some duty – free ones on the plane or ship before arriving .
the customs allow approximately 200 to be brought in by each person over the age of seventeen .
shops and restaurants do not allow customers to use their office telephones , but some have telephone boxes and there are boxes in the street and in public buildings .
when giving numbers to an operator , read each figure separately .
zero is read as the letter ‘ o &apos; .
when the same figures occur together , the word ‘ double &apos; is used .
886103 is ‘ double eight six one o three &apos; .
some of the telephone services available are : emergency calls to the fire brigade , police , and ambulance service , for which you should dial 999 .
a.d.c. which stands for ‘ advise duration and charge &apos; , means that when the call is finished the operator rings you back to tell you how long the call was and how much it cost .
directory enquiries give information about members both in the u.k. and abroad .
personal calls are made to a particular person .
a fixed charge is made for the service , but you do not pay for the time taken to find the person .
if he is not there the call is tried again later without further charge .
transferred-charge calls are paid for by the person receiving the call rather than the caller .
in business , telephones are answered by giving the name of the firm . private telephones are normally answered by giving the number only .
when inquiring about a room it is always a good idea to ask at the beginning whether laundry and heating are included in the price .
if you want to share a flat , look in the ‘ flats to let &apos; column of an evening paper for advertisements like : 4th girl shr.s / c h &apos;stead flt.01-134 2343 evenings .
this means that a fourth girl is required to share a self-contained flat in hampstead , and that enquires should be made by telephone in the evenings .

for many people , easter is a time of high festivity , a time for playing traditional games , dancing , and of course , feasting upon all the food associated with this particular time of year .
it all began centuries ago , when the resurrection of christ brought great joy to followers of christianity .
people the world over started to indulge in all forms of revelry , which ranged from traditional games of egg-rolling to the partying of recent times .
popular customs associated with the time of easter take a variety of forms . easter eggs , later became very prominent as symbols of new life and resurrection .
today , they feature as decorations and as presents exchanged between friends and relatives .
as regards the menu offered at easter parties , although there is no traditional fare to compare with the christmas turkey or goose , a favourite dish on many easter lunch table is roast lamb .
for a tea party , a hostess would probably fill her table with hot cross buns and simnel cakes , without which no easter tea table is complete .
easter table settings are often based on the conventional easter colors of yellow and green .
and for the finishing touches , fluffy yellow chicks , white rabbits and white lilies-all bring home the festival spirit of easter .
many couples choose to acknowledge their love for each other on valentine &apos;s day .
we often give our loved one a token of our appreciation at this time .
love tokens have been given since time immemorial , some more extravagant than others , and some quite unique .
the movie has , needless to say ; provided some classic examples of very special love tokens .
the mercurial relationship between richard burton and elizabeth taylor was marked by many extravagant and romantic gifts .
in l964 ; when burton finished filming the night of the iguana , he gave charming elizabeth a gold dolphin chip with diamonds , emeralds and sapphires which he called the iguana .
perhaps , the most famous royal love match this century was that of the duke and duchess of windsor .
he ordered many different pieces of jewellery from cartier to give to his beloved wallis .
whether it &apos;s romantic , extravagant or simply different , there &apos;s no better way to celebrate your love than with a gift on valentine &apos;s day .
father &apos;s day is a day set aside for honoring fathers in church services and at home .
it is celebrated in the u.s. on the 3rd sunday of june .
this idea was originated by mrs. john dodd .
in 1909 , she persuaded the ministerial society of spokane , washington , to salute fathers with special church services .
in 1924 , president coolidge recommended national observance of the occasion &quot; to establish more intimate relations between fathers and their kids , and to impress upon fathers the full measure of their obligations &quot; . the red or white rose is recognized as the official father &apos;s day flower .
korean meals can be particularly heart-warming ; the camaraderie builds up as the meat sizzles on your table .
spice , of course , is a strong factor ; chilies and pepper form basic seasonings in almost all korean cooking , with garlic and sesame adding richness .
the barbecue-literally &apos; fire beef &apos; is the best known aspect of this cuisine ; our meal began with top grade us short ribs and a plate of assorted meats such as beef , pork and chicken .
the well-marinated slivers cooked quickly on the table , deliciously touching the tongue as they went down .
with it were several varieties of pickled cabbage , radish and cucumber , among other things , traditionally sealed under ground or beneath floorboards of family homes to serve as vegetable protein during the hard winter months in korea .
one of the main features of french cooking is the use of alcohol , mostly wine , but also brandy and in normandy , cider or calvados .
in the south you will find numerous versions of the famous bouillabaisse and in the south-east assault , a stew of haricot beans and either pork or goose .
there are nearly 300 different cheeses from the soft ones to the veined .
there are numerous regional specialties and dishes tend to be heavy and well-spiced in germany .
pork dishes are popular .
soups are very filling and often contain dumplings .
fish dishes are based on trout , carp &amp; salmon .
game dishes are superb .
there are many kinds of cream-filled cakes and pastries and heavy sweets of marzipan or cheese cakes .
honesty and simplicity are the great strengths of cooking in the british isles .
while cooks in other countries rely on garlic and spices to enliven their food , the british approach lets the ingredients speak for themselves .
the two traditional pillars of english cuisine , breakfast and high tea , are unsurpassed anywhere in the world .
lamb has always hen a welcome dish on the english dinner table .
both leg of lamb and cold mutton are among the most traditional of meat courses , along with roast beef .

the federal government runs a betting agency called the tab where you can make your bets .
there is one extremely famous horse race in australia called the melbourne cup .
nearly everyone in australia bets on this race , usually only a very small amount of money just for fun .
when it is time for the race , many people stop working and watch the race on television , or listen to it on the radio to see who wins .

in the eyes of the miao , the dragon is a symbol of good luck .
girls like to adorn their hair with silver ornaments shaped like dragons and wear clothes embroidered or woven with dragon patterns .
the miaos build exquisite &quot; dragon boats &quot; , which are in reality a body formed from three canoes-one large and two small that are strung together .
before a dragon boat sets out , somebody sings an auspicious song to the boatmen , wishing them a good voyage .
the miao dragon boat festival differs from the han celebration .
they are not celebrated on the same date . while the hans only hold dragon boat races during the festival , the miaos take the opportunity to visit friends and relatives .
young men set out in boats early in the morning .
when they approach a village , they fire guns to announce their arrival .
the villagers set off five crackers in response and then go to meet them.the hosts present two cups of rice wine to each man and then tie gifts for their relatives-ducks , geese , and colored silks-onto the heads of the dragon .
horses races and bull fights are held during the festival .
girls in holiday dress dance to the accompaniment of drums .
it &apos;s not unusual for young people to meet their future spouses at the songfests held on festival nights .
income is a very important factor in the australian society .
relatively speaking , the distribution of income in australia is fairly even .
this , perhaps , is because australia emphasizes its egalitarianism , and takes it as a kind of tradition .
despite this , the incomes of businessmen or professionals rose more rapidly than those of labour workers , especially in the postwar years .
the same is also true of skilled workers and unskilled workers .
generally speaking , the average male is more likely to get a job in the manufacturing , wholesale and retail trade or services industries .
women comprise around 40 % of australia &apos;s total workforce .
according to a survey , the occupations with the highest prestige are physician , university professor , lawyer , architect , engineer , large business owner and manager , dentist , and clergymen .
and those occupations such as porters , night watchmen , waitresses , packers , and street sweepers are regarded as the bottom of the scale .
education is an important factor in determining occupational status .
the most highly regarded occupations are often professional and white-collar jobs with higher income but requiring higher education .
in contrast , the bottommost occupations that require little education consist entirely of unskilled manual workers ; who they get relatively less income .

they give top priority to their holidays and will always put away everything to enjoy .
this , perhaps , is rare in the world .
